Aly L.,5 star rating,"Aug 31, 2024","Our food and service was great!! Jorge was our server and he made our party feel extra special with recommendations and his attentiveness. We ordered the grilled lobster and the risotto, yum!! The drawn butter leans towards the salty side, but is great in moderation. We'd definitely return."
waterlily f.,1 star rating,"Sep 1, 2024","This is a huge disappointment - we saw it has 4.5 star reviews so we decided to give it a try. Ordered oysters, chowder, and cioppino  - standard seafood order right? Terrible! Oyster comes with only vinaigrette, without even a spoon. Forget oyster folk. No hot sauce or cocktail sauce. Oyster liquid is drained off. Asked for horse radish and spoon. They suggest to pour vinaigrette over oyster. Mind you this is not eating in a farmers market. Horse radish came, but is canned not fresh. Overpowering. For the price. Not worth it. Then the clam chowder. Just a cup, no oyster cracker with it. Asked for cracker, waiter brought 2 stale saltine crackers, said all he could find. . the stale cracker with soggy texture ruined the chowder all together. The cioppino  - a SF classic - is flavorless - lack of salt and acidity. while the fish is fresh, the broth tasted like canned tomato sauce and it didn't come with a lemon. As former SF residents (moved to the South Bay) we were looking forward to try out these ""standard"" dishes again in a new restaurant and this is a HUGE disappointment. Our waiter - while came to check us a few times. need training on what should come with these dishes - or the kitchen staff needs basic training. If you like great tasting seafood, avoid this place."
Elayna D.,3 star rating,"Sep 1, 2024","A Pier 39 restaurant. It is located at Pier 39, which is the Times Square of SF. A ton of tourists, tourist attractions and prob some tourist traps. I read so many great reviews of this place that I tried it out for my bday dinner. I do advise making reservations, they were really busy and crowded on a Sunday around 730pm. I had a table for 1 and still waited a short while for a table.I was served bread and water before receiving the menu, once my waitress introduced herself, I ordered appetizers. The calamari and the mussel fries. I was so excited to order based on the pictures, but everything that looks good isn't necessarily good. The calamari arrived lukewarm, it wasn't prepared fresh and if it was that means it sat there waiting for someone to bring it to me. I am going to say it wasn't fresh because once I ordered it didn't take an exceptionally long time to get my food. The mussels were ok, the broth was flavorful and the fries were basic fries with garlic sauce on top( terrible fries). I wouldn't order either dish again.As for service, the waitress was seen bouncing from table to table, but was attentive as she could be with the crowd. It is a decent place for a date night, but I suggest venturing AWAY from Pier 39.I was looking and craving that foodie experience that so many rave about in SF and this just didn't work for me. I was later told "" the locals never eat at Pier 39!"" Same thing I was told my first visit to NYC"
Dmitry D.,4 star rating,"Aug 30, 2024",So the view is amazing we sat right in the window over looking Alcatraz beat seats ever.Now the service wasn't the worst but when your waiter doesn't write stuff down and you have big order not sure how good they are but ours wasn't perfect . He forgot a dish we ordered and really wanted to try .The food wasn't bad flavored but the pasta was to oily and greasy.The seafood tasted good but it was smaller size shrimp and craps than what I expected for the price and the crabs were over cooked and dry.The bread was really good like wow good.And over wasn't the worst but when you go to a place looking forward to the dish that wasn't made for you it sucks .
Catherine B.,5 star rating,"Aug 26, 2024","Fog Harbor Fish House seems like a quintessential part of SF and Pier 39. It was the first and last touristy restaurant I visited in my three years in the Bay. It's a restaurant that requires a reservation and one that you can easily take visiting parents to. I've been three times and tried most of their menu items; here are the highlights:- best clam chowder I've had in SF (not that I'm an expert on soup but it's well seasoned without being salty which is rare to my tastebuds) (since the restaurant serves free sourdough, I recommend getting a regular large instead of the ""iconic"" yet impractical bread bowl although I've ordered it one too many times haha)- another iconic part of this restaurant is the huge dessert platter with the clay replicas of all their desserts (it's fun to choose and so hard not to ask for one of everything sigh) (creme brulee, lava cake, and biscoff cheesecake were all solid desserts)- all of their fish dishes are above average (in order of yumminess, I've had their seafood boil, crab cakes, steamed crab, calamari, fish and chips, mahi mahi, and cioppino)- all of their pastas are pretty average (since it's such a huge restaurant, you can't expect much care in how they cook the pasta, so if you want to order one, I'd switch out penne for linguine to preserve the texture somewhat) (also I thought their oil pastas were higher quality than their tomato based ones)Overall, it's pricy but a good experience and my parents were willing to return (which is a huge win when you have Asian parents iykyk)"
Amy S.,5 star rating,"Sep 1, 2024",I ate here on a Sunday afternoon. The wait was long but it was worth it. Upon seating they bottled water and bread. I had oysters and the fish and chips. It was delicious and crispy. It was extremely busy but they seem to be on top of it. I'd for sure go back.
Babu G.,5 star rating,"Aug 31, 2024","This restaurant requires a reservation or be prepared for a long wait! It's extremely popular at the pier so I'd recommend making a reservation. Also if u can't eat seafood they don't have much options so be prepared! This place has amazing seafood dishes if u are a seafood lover! All of their appetizers was great and the main entree we got was also good. The server took care of us really well and constantly checked up on us. The ambience inside was also really beautiful, we sat at the edge of the restaurant overlooking the ocean. We got to watch the sunset while having our dinner. Make sure to come during sunset for the best experience!"
Tina V.,4 star rating,"Aug 27, 2024",Can't go wrong with clam chowder in a bread bowl when in SF. It came out fast and piping hot. It had a good amount of clams in the soup and definitely hit the spot! Service was really good. Nice place to chill at.
Johnna G.,5 star rating,"Aug 3, 2024","We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday right at 11:00AM and were seated right away. This spot filled up quickly! So I'm glad we got there when we did. We were seated at a bay front table and were able to see Alcatraz. Nice view, especially since the fog was starting to burn off. The service was great. Prompt and friendly. The menu is great and it was hard to choose. We ended up ordering a few things and sharing. We ordered two appetizers: Spicy Shrimp and the Ahi Tuna stack. Both were good. The spicy shrimp was spicy, but flavorful. We also ordered the Crab and Avocado Cesar salad, which was delicious, and the Shrimp Borchette, also delicious and huge portion. We aren't from the area and due to location, we were a little worried it was a tourist trap, but it wasn't. Definitely good and did not disappoint."
Alyssa A.,5 star rating,"Aug 6, 2024","Came back again two weeks later to bring my familyOctopus was my fave  HIGHLY RECOMMEND seafood platter + octopusStuck to the muscle fries and hibiscus brut (same as last time)If you like lobster bisque, order it w the crab meat"
Iago A.,5 star rating,"Aug 5, 2024","I came back to the bay for an event and my friend recommended this restaurant. I'm glad he did. The wait was only 15min. As soon as we sat, we had our drink order taken and bread brought. Our server was very friendly! I ordered the baked oysters and a cup of clam chowder! And wow! So rich! Definitely one of the best clam chowders if tasted. It wasn't to loud in there and the view of Alcatraz and the harbor was epic! I'll be back to try more of the menu! Thanks again!"
Laura G.,5 star rating,"Jul 23, 2024","We had an amazing dinner last night. The hostesses were  super nice and our table was ready within 10 minutes of us entering. We started with the side salads. They were fresh delicious with a tasty vinegar based dressing. They also brought you fresh rolls and soft butter. Yum. We shared two meals, the scallops were cooked perfectly and the risotto was super yummy., The star was the cioppino. It was filled with a ton of varied seafood in a red broth. We got an anniversary surprise from our sweet waitress, it was the perfect ending. Between the gorgeous scenery, the great service and the delicious food I am not surprised this restaurant is super busy. We felt like we were treated as special guests. We really appreciated that. We will certainly return."
Erin G.,4 star rating,"Aug 25, 2024","no wait time for a party of 7 on a friday during lunchtime! it was busy, but there were plenty of tables! ambiance is amazing, like your typical seafood restaurant with views of the water and plenty of natural sunlight! the food was everything we expected. we all came with empty stomachs and left feeling satisfied. we always like to start with some calamari-- which was amazing! it also came with fried onions and jalapeños which was very unique! i ordered the scallops and crab risotto and it was so buttery and yummy! everyone enjoyed their orders and were able to pick off each others plates. prices were hefty, as expected, but i would say worth it as seafood is not cheap. i wasn't able to try the desserts but i kept eyeing the ones i would see being brought to the other tables and they looked delicious!"
Michelle T.,4 star rating,"Jul 31, 2024","An iconic restaurant in Fisherman's Wharf. For the longest time I refrained from coming here because I believed it to be a tourist trap. However, I was surprised on my first and most recent visit and I found the food to be absolutely delicious.Our visit got off on a rocky start. I made reservations for our party of 8 a month ago. We arrived on time, but had to wait for 40 MINUTES as they were clearing the tables. This was crazy to me because I heard them quote a walk-in party of 7 one hour wait. So...what was my reservation for?This was during a busy Saturday summertime lunch so I understand it was busy, but the expectations need to be improved. Eventually we were seated and our server was excellent - friendly, funny, efficient. The menu said ""best clam chowder in San Francisco"" so, of course, we HAD to order the chowder. It was excellent...and the best clam chowder I've had in Bay Area. (Get the bread bowl with it! You won't regret it)I also ordered a very delicious cioppino and mussel fries, which were literally just mussels with fries on top but it was quite tasty.I will be back...but maybe on a not-so-busy day."
Daniella P.,5 star rating,"Aug 19, 2024","We decided to stop by to try their famous clam chowder. The interior looked good but the view from our table looked even better. We had a nice window view that overlooked the pier. We ordered some oysters which were probably some of the most fresh oysters I've ever tasted. Our clam chowder came shortly after in a nice, hot bread bowl. They really lived up to their name as the best clam chowder in SF. It was creamy and seasoned well. We had such a great experience here."
Rachel D.,4 star rating,"Aug 19, 2024","Overall good experience. This was my 2nd time here. For some reason, the host skipped my name in the queue but it was all worked out when I went to check in with her. Service was phenomenal after that. Jorge was pleasant and incredibly helpful with the menu choices. The food was delicious and I was very pleased with the seafood pasta especially. Ambiance was great as a I remembered it and we were seated by the window with a great view."
Alyssa S.,4 star rating,"Aug 21, 2024","Came here for a birthday dinner with a few friends. We had reservations and requested window seat. It took forever to be seated even with reservations, and didn't get window seat we asked for but once finally seated we completely enjoyed our meal. Everything we had was so fresh and delicious. We even got a complimentary birthday dessert for my friends birthday and we left very happy and full."
Thuy N.,3 star rating,"Aug 21, 2024","I was intrigued by the amount of reviews this place had and decided to come here while in sf. There was no wait at 11am on a Thursday, and our servers were very kind and informative about the menu. They give complementary bread, which I appreciate and it was delicious! I tried the clam chowder and wow it did live up to the hype! However the pasta dishes were a bit disappointing. They were bland and lacked flavor. I do like the huge serving size which makes the price a bit worth it. I just wish it had more flavor. If I were to come back here, it would be for the view and ambiance since you can see Alcatraz island."
Rae Lynn Z.,4 star rating,"Jul 21, 2024","Stopped here for lunch after a scattering of ashes ceremony in the Bay for a friend.We shared the blue cheese garlic bread, I had the octopus appetizer and a house salad as a meal, my friends both had clam chowder to start and one had the fish and chips, the other the shrimp brocette.  All the seafood was fresh and delicious. The entree sized meals were big enough that both took leftovers home.My blood orange margarita was delicious, but my friends Mai Tai was way too strong with no real flavor, just an alcohol taste. Service was great, with our waiter teasing my friend about her KC Chiefs sweatshirt. .   The only negative is it can get loud, but it is a draw for visitors, so not a surprise."
Sean S.,5 star rating,"Jul 14, 2024","This spot absolutely lives up to its above average ratings, highlighted by great good at fair prices with attentive service and a gorgeously glistening waterfront view. Any seafood on the pier is going to come at a premium, but the prices and experience here are on par or above any others I have had in the area, and I've tried quite a few. Even the wine prices are reasonable, and in such a touristy area that can be hard to come by. My partner loves to eat a whole crab for her birthday and this is the fourth year we've tried a new spot, and we have a winner. The whole crab comes with excellent potatoes and vegetables, and the clam chowder we added on has just the right amount of smoky bacon flavor to accent the rich oceanic flavor of the chowder. My cioppino was excellent with a pretty thick and flavorful broth with ample quality fish, shrimp, scallops, and mussels for every bite. Not to mention the perfectly fired calamari appetizer that comes with a delightfully garlic-heavy tartar sauce that's simply divine. I can't recommend this place enough, Fog Harbor is the real deal."
Sky R.,4 star rating,"Aug 31, 2024","As many of the great long lasting restaurants (Neptune's, Aliotti's, Fisherman's Grotto, Castagna's) located at San Francisco' Fisherman's Wharf have closed since COVID, we were looking for a new restaurant and discovered Fog Harbor. We shared a Caesar Salad and Chappino which was plenty for two for.  Although the staff was very friendly we had to ask multiple times for refills and Salt&Pepper.   It seemed like they were rushing people  through to turn tables quickly.  We probably would return if we were in the area again, but not a destination restaurant."
Maneet G.,5 star rating,"Jul 5, 2024","Truly the best seafood restaurant in the SF Bay Area! My husband and I visited for our five year anniversary. I had made reservations prior and we were seated by the window with a picturesque view of the ocean.Our waiter was very friendly and efficient and bought us hot sourdough bread to start with butter. So delicious!  We ordered the clam chowder, seafood penne, and fish n chips. The food came out so fast with the chowder first. That chowder is award winning and we saw why! It was so creamy and had lovely bits of clam and potato. It's heavy but such a treat! The seafood penne was amazing! The tomato cream sauce was so flavorful and there was a plentiful amount of seafood in the dish. My husband ate it all! Totally cleaned his plate!The fish and chips were great too with a crispy batter and tender fish that flaked inside. The fries were just your normal ones but good. The tartar sauce was on par and perfect!The whole meal was incredible and highly recommended. The chowder and seafood penne stood out as a notch above the rest! I would definitely come back again! And again!"
Sean P.,5 star rating,"Aug 30, 2024",Fantastic experience! Luis really took care of us! We loved his recommendations. Service was quick and efficient! I can't really complain about it! Would love to come back!
Betty J.,5 star rating,"Jun 20, 2024","When I like to treat myself, I come here. It's not a meal to be taken lightly. My last dining experience here was $100 with the tip. I did have steak and lobster for lunch though.Service here is always incredible. You can come in and sit at the bar or wait for a table when I'm by myself I prefer just to sit at the bar. Always great service no matter where I sit and always busy but definitely worth the wait The lobster was cooked perfectly. My steak was a little bit over, but not enough that I was going to send it back. Next time I would probably get the double lobster tail and save the steak for someplace else because fog Harbor fish house really does do the best fish And seafood dishes.They have a great list. Appetizers are incredible so you could come and fill up on appetizers as my friend and I did one day we just kind of went down the list until we were full ha ha If you are only going to come here one time, make a reservation or wait for a table by the window because the view is amazing! If you don't end up with the table that has a view can walk outside afterwards and take a look at the sea lions. However, I recommend , walk down to the next pier over to the north of the restaurant and walk to the end of it. You will get a much better view of Alcatraz and the sea lions without all the crowds."
Harlee S.,5 star rating,"Jun 28, 2024","The food is unbelievably good. This is definitely the spot on Pier 39 to get some good grub. You know how seafood restaurants usually don't have good pasta meals. We'll this place is the exception. The pasta was fantastic and so flavorful. The fish and chips was probably the best I've ever had. And that bruschetta was to did for!I loved the vibe, the menu and the service. All of it was so worth it."
Allison N.,5 star rating,"Jun 27, 2024","Went to this restaurant while walking through the pier. The wait around 5 PM for a table of 2 on a Friday was about 20 minutes, but there were lounge chairs where you can sit and wait for your table.I didn't want to get too extremely full as I planned to visit additional restaurants along the pier, but that was a nearly impossible plan since I wanted to order and eat everything. Clam chowder in bread bowl - 5/5 stars. This chowder was creamy and had plenty of clam meat in it. Definitely worth trying. The bread bowl was super fluffy. I recommend eating and finishing it while it's hot before your other dishes come out!Whole roasted Dungeness crab - 4.75/5 stars. Served with crab leg crackers tools and a bib, no gloves (we forgot to ask whether or not they had gloves.) The crab was so fragrant and had so much meat. It was cooked perfectly as the crab meat was not stuck to the shell. Note that they already removed the crab shell from the legs and extracted all the buttery tomalley, so if you order this looking to eat that, you're not going to get it.Overall 4.8/5 stars. Keeping this in my bookmarks and will definitely come back to try more items!Edit: The staff that served us was amazing and kept checking up on us :)"
Valerie C.,5 star rating,"Jun 23, 2024",Did a clam chowder crawl and I didn't think I would find my favorite clam chowder place to visit at Pier 39! The restaurant was packed so we decided to sit at the bar since we just wanted clam chowder and did a half order of  Kumamoto oysters! The oysters were so delicious but the size consistency was all over the place so I wished they were the same size for $27.Clam chowder in a bowl is $11 which is cheaper than the other spots in pier 39! I like that it was creamy and not salty! It paired really nicely with sourdough bread :) I will definitely be back to try other entrees and appetizers!!

Frank M.,5 star rating,"Aug 9, 2024","I visited a few weeks ago on a vacation here! Got the mixed grill and LOVED it, best food I had the whole time! Everything cooked perfectly! They kept my water full always--and the yuzu Negroni was better than I expected! Spicy, but a fruity taste I won't forget. The view--equally great; but more for family style than a date."
Hong N.,3 star rating,"Jun 18, 2024","I personally didn't try the oysters because I'm a big believer in not eating shellfish during the summer seasons. According to the big boys, the oysters had some sand, but it's still good. Ironically, they both shortly felt unwell and ill once we got back home. So, please, my fellow readers, eat at your own risk. The clam chowder was delicious and creamy. Crab cakes were alright, the sauce added a nice touch. The halibut was a bit too dry for my taste. Everyone else loved it.IMO, the Scallop and Crab Risotto tasted very fishy and the flavors were more on the heavier side. Overall, I had a great experience. Service was great and I'll mostly be back for more of that clam chowder!"
Kayla S.,5 star rating,"Aug 11, 2024","Luis was our server and he was outstanding!! We ordered the Red Chili Garlic Shrimp, Clam Chowder and the SWORDFISH is amazing!!! Best dish ever. Plus they gave us a surprise dessert for my husband's birthday! Can't wait to come back."
Cheryl M.,4 star rating,"Jul 28, 2024","Friend coordinated a beautiful day in the City of taking the ferry, perusing the Ferry Building and having lunch at Pier 39. I had my reservations about dining in a touristy area with overpriced and pedestrian food but was pleasantly surprised. I suggested Fog Harbor Fish House since we were already in the area and friends didn't have suggestions. Fortunately, they had a variety of menu items to please everyone, not overly fancy and familiar. I suggested we do family style to sample various dishes. 4 stars for items ordered:   *  Baked Bruschetta - tomato, aioli pesto, balsamic - simple but delicious    *  Crab Cakes - good amount of Dungeness Crab (vs breading) and harissa aioli and mango    *  Clams - steamed clams with butter, garlic, white wine - delicious but wish we had some bread to soak up all the broth goodness!   *  Fish and Chips - lightly battered cod,  perfectly cooked friesAll delicious, flavorful and priced about right. Our server, Amy (along with staff) were true professionals: friendly, welcoming, and efficient. We got there about 12 and wasn't too busy...by the time we left, the place was bustling! Casual attire (shorts, flip flops) during the day as most were tourist. Parking garage located across the street with validation for the first hour. Public transportation: BART or take the ferry with a 1.5 mile walk. When you're with good company it's a quick walk and part of the experience  :)"
Sherry F.,5 star rating,"Jun 16, 2024","Popular seafood restaurant with stunning views of the pier that give the impression of dining on a boat.   It's right on Fisherman's Wharf, so will be flooded with tourists (like us, heh), but the seafood is good. Tables started getting filled around noon on the Saturday we went, but we didn't have to wait too long for food to arrive. As a family of four, we shared three dishes and were decently full from it, as we all have small stomachs lol. Award Winning Clam Chowder Bowl $10 - cheaper and a bit better than Boudin's! Mixed Grill $32 (comes with salmon, shrimp, cod, mashed potatoes and veggies) - Salmon and shrimp were both really well cooked and seasoned. The cod was slightly bland and the veggies were a lil hard, but the mashed potatoes were good.  Seared Scallop & Crab Risotto $39 - Really enjoyed this dish, as the scallops were cooked nicely. The risotto came out warm but it quickly got cold :/"
Catalina M.,5 star rating,"Aug 7, 2024","Very popular spot with a beautiful view. I was able to avoid the long line by grabbing a seat at the very spatious bar. I was on the fence about the bread bowl for my clam chowder but was pleasantly surprised to find out sour dough rolls were included. My husband enjoyed the mostly local beer selection.  If you're coming from out of town, this is a great place to stop."
Tormy L.,5 star rating,"Aug 18, 2024","The view is to die for . You can see Alcatraz and the golden gate !!! Food was to good soup was so good , fish and chips so good , steak was extremely food . The lady was so patient and nice to us she understood my daughter allergies and they make it work."
Stacy D.,5 star rating,"Jul 28, 2024","We were in San Fran for just the day and wanted seafood and wanted to give another restaurant a clam chowder try. I looked on yelp and this place popped up. I was able to get in on the Yelp waitlist right away at around 5:30 PM. I was # 27 and for some reason it said that my table was ready and only had to wait for maybe 5-10 min. We were seated and had a nice view of harbor and Golden Gate Bridge. Our kind server was Jorge & he was spectacular and had a very nice personality! He is a Hapa like me, and what was really cool is that he could speak Spanish to my husband and Japanese to me. We ordered following appetizers : 1. Fried calamari with a perfect crisp, and very tender & fresh with lemon aoli dip and fried jalapeños and onions (double yum) 5/5!2. Poke (5/5) super yum and fresh and good flavor. It came with these crispy won tons with cubed avocado, mango, etc w/delicious creamy wasabi dressing & keep in mind we aren't huge wasabi fans and we loved it ! Also, there was a seaweed garnish that added a wonderful taste. Meals as follows: 1. Small cup of clam chowder for me and bowl for my hubby. Super tasty flavor, thick and perfect amount of clams etc. almost got crab added but glad I didn't. It was so perfect! I got the small cup with the complimentary yummy, warm, sour dough bread with butter-5/5! My most fav clam chowder I have ever had in my life- really! 2. Kids meal :chicken tenders and fries (5/5) super yummy 3. Kids meal: cheeseburger fries (5/5) super good !Drinks: Pinot noir and modelo (5/5)Desert: blonde brownie desert with vanilla icecreamw/whipped cream (4/5) It could have been less ""nutty"" and no nuts @ all! I think there were way too many nuts. Still good ! I didn't get to choose, so.. lolNext time, I would select the caramel apple crumble desert with vanilla ice cream as the server suggested it was his fav ! Overall, 5/5 & will def return again!! Domo Arigato ! Note: 1st place in Monterey (Fisheman's grotto) the clam chowder was a 4/5. The 2nd place in Monterey, it was awful 2/5 (very runny and salty). No comment on the name of restaurant,  but won't return. So glad we had a wonderful experience @ Fog !!"

Stephanie G.,5 star rating,"Aug 2, 2024","So this restaurant was a recommendation and let me tell you it did not disappoint! My husband and I really enjoy seafood, so we were excited to try this spot! They sat us with a great view of the bay and Alcatraz. We were greeted by our waiter, Luis who was very knowledgeable on the menu and came in quick with great recommendations! He was so helpful during the entire dinner and even took photos of us! (Thank you!) we definitely recommend this restaurant and ask for Luis when you do stop by! You won't regret it!"
Alicia F.,4 star rating,"Jul 19, 2024","San Francisco is expensive, tourist traps are more expensive, now that the obvious is out of the way, let's get into it: I've gone to Fog Harbor twice now, once for a work lunch and once with my family for dinner and I'll break down both experiences. For our work lunch, we were able to snag a table for 10 at noon on a Wednesday, no problem. We were seated by a window on a beautiful sunny day. Service was great. It was my first time here, and honestly just because it's on the Pier, my expectations were extremely low and I was shocked how good it was! We got a round of apps for the table including the crispy calamari and crab dip. The calamari had crispy jalapenos and this tangy lemon aioli. I would come back for this alone and a beer, it was very good. You also can't go wrong with some warm bread and butter. I had a seafood penne for my entree and paired it was a ginger lemonade. Let me tell you, they did not skimp on the seafood. Super impressive, for $29 I was loaded up with a ton of shrimp, clams, and mussels. I was overly full and plenty left over. I also really enjoyed the ginger lemonade, a great NA option. The creme brulee was a little disappointing, as it didn't have that great crack sensation we are always looking for.Now for the dinner experience with my family:I tried to reserve a table, in person, the day before because on Yelp reservations, it only allows for tables up to 6. I was told I couldn't make a reservation in person and refer to the app and just leave a note that it was going to be 7 people. This was a little annoying but minor detail. It was a busy Thursday night and we got seated right at the time of our reservation which was 6:30 PM. We had the best waiter! My parents don't speak English and luckily, he could communicate with them in Spanish which was so awesome! My 80 year old dad gets nervous going to these ""fancy shmancy"" like places, so it's so nice seeing him comfortable. Obviously, we got the calamari, delic! We opted for a seafood tower for two, poke, and I tried the clam linguini this time. Loved the seafood options, would pass on the linguini next time, it was a little bland. Overall, it is a tourist trap but if you're spending the day on the Pier or Fisherman's Wharf, it's a great place to dine in, if you're looking for something not as casual."
Priscilla L.,5 star rating,"Jun 1, 2024","Some time ago, Tommy Hall, the founding member of the American psychedelic rock band the 13th Floor Elevators, ventured out from his usual reclusive lifestyle to dine with us, and he was thoroughly impressed. We took an Uber to Pier 39, eager to try the restaurant that came so highly recommended.Tommy savored every bite of his swordfish topped with a rich pesto aioli, perfectly accompanied by roasted peppers, red onions, zucchini, and fingerling potatoes, served with a delectable chimichurri sauce. It's clear that Tommy has an incredible palate for great food.George Ripley and I enjoyed the Fish & Chips, featuring beer-battered fresh cod and a side of crisp cole slaw. The dish was exceptional, elevating a classic favorite to new heights with its perfectly crispy batter and tender, flavorful fish.Adding to the delightful evening, George Ripley shared insights from his recent work on two documentaries: ""The 13th Floor Elevators Story"" and ""Slip Inside This House: The Tommy Hall Story."" It was a night of fantastic food and fascinating conversation.You can read more about Tommy Hall in this 2009 SF Weekly article by Jennifer Maerz:https://www.sfweekly.com/music/a-long-strange-trip/article_0871305a-094e-5327-9a65-999be305d937.html"
Neema B.,3 star rating,"May 28, 2024","For our last night in San Francisco, we were searching for good seafood. Everything I saw from locals prior to visiting said to skip Pier 39 because it's a tourist trap and there's much better food in other areas of the city. So while this wasn't my first choice, we were close by and decided to visit. Honestly, it gave Red Lobster vibes to me for some reason. I had a hard time selecting something I wanted to eat that day. Ultimately I went with a special dish on the menu, which was the halibut, served over succotash with corn, beans and tomatoes in a beurre blanc. The sauce was very flavorful, the vegetables too, but the halibut lacked flavor to me. It also seemed a bit overcooked. On my next visit I would likely find a local seafood spot outside of the pier. Overall, the staff was friendly and service was good. The food came out fast, and the restaurant has plenty of seating plus beautiful views. We visited at night and since we didn't sit by a window, we didn't have the best view of the pier, but I can understand why it's so popular."
Miranda T.,5 star rating,"May 27, 2024","Came here for dinner with my family and had a terrific experience! The atmosphere was casual and lively and we were seated near the window so we got a nice view of the harbor.Service was attentive and the food was delicious. They provided complimentary sourdough rolls to start. The rolls were so soft and chewy on the inside and had a nice crispy crust. Then we ordered the mixed grill, Caesar salad with crab, and soup and salad combo. The mixed grill and soup and salad combo were fantastic. The portions were generous and it was great value. Would highly recommend giving both dishes a try. However, the Caesar salad was a bit disappointing because the addition of crab was quite expensive for very little quantity."
Kassie E.,4 star rating,"May 27, 2024","Ambiance:- The views from this place are stunning! I decided to bring my mom for Mother's day. They sat us right by a window and since we went for dinner, we were able to catch the sunset.- Pretty busy restaurant. Partly because of the holiday and also because of location. It is right in the heart of Fishermans Wharf.- Arrived 10 minutes earlier than our reservation and were sat down right away.Food:- Yummy! I am usually hesitant about places that are in the middle of tourist locations. Usually food is overpriced and not good. I must admit that it is a bit pricey, but you get a good amount of food and it tastes good.- Below is what we ordered for two. This was more than enough food and had leftovers:STARTERS:1. Crispy Calamari (5/5)2. Oysters (1/2 Dozen) (4/5)3. Bowl of Clam Chowder (5/5)HOUSE SPECIALTIES1. Shellfish Platter for 1 (5/5)Service:- From start to end, the service was great. Everyone was friendly and made us feel seen/ heard.- Even when there were items on the menu that were sold out, they tried their best to provide options so that we could still try everything we wanted."

Madison P.,5 star rating,"May 23, 2024","This was a great fine dining experience in SF. It's located in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf with a perfect view of the bay, complete with lots of seals!! We started with the Humboldt oysters, blue cheese garlic bread and a bowl of their ""best clam chowder in San Francisco"" - which we all agreed was truly some of the best we've ever had!!For my main course, I had the linguini with clams and it was delicious. No shortage of clam meat, either! Bongjovi was an excellent server and just the right amount of attentive (: Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for a nice dinner."
Rey C.,5 star rating,"May 23, 2024","Fog Harbor is still the best place to eat seafood. A bit pricey but hey you're at the forefront of Pier 39 so expect to pay prices much higher here than other places. Nonetheless my kids are much older now since my last review and we're all adults. The fish continues to be extremely fresh and the clams and mussels in my seafood penne were very fresh. The swordfish, Petra sole and mixed seafood along with the kumamoto oysters were on par!  We enjoyed the warm and crunchy complimentary bread baskets which filled us up. Our waiter whose name I already forget was very attentive despite the busy atmosphere. He said he's only been around for 3 years and never had a chance to visit Alcatraz. Hopefully he can someday and he was very nice. Overall great experience and we hope to be back again someday."
Melanie E.,5 star rating,"Aug 25, 2024","Always on par, got the shellfish platter as usual and added crab cakes... delicious and delightful, with lovely bread and a wonderful tartar sauce that made everything even better!

Nikki B.,4 star rating,"Jul 22, 2024","The service is good at this restaurant and the food is okay as well. Nothing exceptional per my point of view, if you're hungry and you're craving Italian near Pier39 -- then you should check it out. I am removing a star because I waited for 30 mins to be seated when I was told it would be 5 instead. I also had a newborn baby with me in a stroller. When we were getting seated, I was asked to put the stroller to the side of the restaurant and I blinked at the waitress asking ""what do you mean??"" My newborn can't sit at a high chair yet, she can't even lift her head yet! Annoying."
Aiza C.,5 star rating,"Aug 20, 2024","Great service, great food. The place is clean with lots of tables and great views. It's an iconic restaurant for sure. We got the mixed grill and a lobster roll! Would come back again :)"
Nini M.,3 star rating,"Jul 8, 2024","Wait was about an hour, grant it was a sat morning so I understood but it was PACKED. We had to sit outside because we had dogs. Service was very very slow. We ordered everything right away but it took forever to come out. We sat directly under the sun and they couldn't accommodate another umbrella. So it was lightweight miserable to eat. Our drinks were getting hot. On to the food.. the calamari was to die for. It was so good and came with fried jalapeño which we loved. I got the coppacino, I think that's how you spell it. It's a seafood combination with tomatoe broth/sauce. It was okay. Really nothing special about it. The mussels were fresh. I had to get rice to eat with it. Clam chowder was okay, 4/10. Needed more clam and flavor. Overall I was excited to try this place but it wasn't that great. Maybe I'll give it another try."
Savannah M.,5 star rating,"Sep 1, 2024","Our server Jorge was sooo amazing he was very kind and personable & gave us amazing recommendations!

Demi S.,5 star rating,"Jul 10, 2024","Beautiful ambiance overlooking Pier 39. We ordered the crab cakes, fried scallops,  the risotto, and the tiramisu. 10/10. Shout out to Michael for providing stellar service."
Trecie M.,3 star rating,"Aug 22, 2024","I would try this restaurant again, but I need another dish because what I got seemed like a sample size portion.  The lobster stuffed crab will definitely leave you still hungry.  I think that  they hope you're going to fill up on the potatoes, but I ordered it for the seafood, not potatoes.  The menu stated half lobster, but maybe not an adult size lobster, and the taste of crab does not warrant the price.  I got more bread than entrée."
Nea A.,3 star rating,"Jul 23, 2024","Came here for a date, and we got Luis as our server. He was so attentive and made sure we never felt forgotten despite them being busy. Cause of that it was really loud and crowded in the restaurant, felt at times that you could bump into a table with how crammed it was. Out of all of the dishes we order the calamari was our favorite. The mixed grill was good as well just lukewarm when I got it. And the clam chowder was decent. All in all we would just come back for the calamari and cocktails."

Phil M.,3 star rating,"Aug 30, 2024","This is definitely a touristy place. The food is just OK. The best thing on the menu is the bread! There's tons of weight staff, but the service was not great. The food is overpriced and I definitely would not go back."
Lynn Z.,5 star rating,"Aug 15, 2024","This place seriously has the best clam chowder!! I'm quite the chowder connoisseur and the bread bowl with chowder here is phenomenal. Crab cakes are also fantastic. I've only been here twice but plan on coming back as much as my wallet will let me (it's worth every Penny)! The service is great and the vibe is very chill attire ranges from casual to high end. Even if you make a reservation you may have to wait, I didn't mind as I knew it would be worth it. Truly fun place to be."
Ines P.,5 star rating,"Jul 8, 2024","Best food! I am celiac and have to eat gluten free. They had many options and I chose the chicken meal. The fried fish (non gf) looked amazing and was had by two people, the wedge salad - DELISH! The tuna was amazing!  The ambiance was great and I can't recommend this place enough! The views are beautiful as well."
Cee B.,4 star rating,"Jul 15, 2024","First time walking the pier and had worked up an appetite for seafood. As I wondered around I found ""Crab House"" and after looking at the menu I could imagine myself paying $100 for a plate of crustaceans without any sides or any desirable sides to ask for as an upcharge. Therefore I kept looking and found ""Fog Harbor Fish House"". I was seen immediately and I'm guessing because not too many were lined up to pay the fine dining prices. Nonetheless I was helped by Alex G with an eagerness to make me feel welcomed and well taken care of.  The young man did an excellent job representing the quality of service that accompanied my meal. I ordered the platter and was expecting to have to be lifted out of the restaurant afterwards  but, the portion size was not that big. The value, I would say is a 3 out of 5 and the taste I would give a 3 out of 5 because they gave a TON of GARLIC and BUTTER with the dish and really no seasoning (what I was hoping for.) Nevertheless I was grateful for the experience, location (because it's overlooking the pier, and the service.), and the ability to afford such a well established place.-Alex if you or the management staff is reading this, Thanks Again!‍"
Allison H.,4 star rating,"Apr 14, 2024","My bf and I decided to eat here for his birthday. Atmosphere: Clean and bright. Nice glass windows where you can look out into the waters.Food: We got the half dozen oysters, clam chowder in a bread bowl, and the fish & chips. The oysters tasted fresh with great presentation. The clam chowder was creamy and flavorful. The sourdough was not my favorite. I liked the complimentary bread more than the sourdough. I absolutely loved the fish & chips. The fish was nice and flaky and the batter was thin and crispy. It's a nice place to eat after walking around the pier. They have great food selection. I would love to bring my family next time."
Nikhil U.,5 star rating,"Jun 29, 2024","Came here with a family party of 10. The wait for such a large group could be long but we ended up getting a table sooner than expected. Food was great and we ordered all sorts of sea food. The kids also loved their food. The oysters were good, but I think a tad bit expensive compared to other places. We had bottles of the house Pinot and the house Chardonnay which were pretty good as well. The service was also excellent. All in all a good seafood dinner in a busy touristy place for a large group! A win all over."
Tiffany L.,4 star rating,"Apr 12, 2024","4.5 stars! I had low expectations for what I thought would be a Fisherman's Wharf tourist trap. I came on a sunny Saturday afternoon around 2:30pm and was seated shortly after checking in. If you're lucky enough to snag a table near the window, you can enjoy the beautiful views of the ocean and city. Our waitress was speedy and attentive, despite the huge restaurant being packed. - Clam chowder bread bowl: A must-order if you're visiting SF. This tasted okay. Wasn't the best I've had, but definitely not the worst. I prefer Boudin's or Hog Island's.- Seafood platter for one ($44): Imagine garlic noodles piled with flavorful clams, mussels, shrimps, and half a Dungeness crab. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the seafood. The noodles were a tad oily for my taste. Large portion - this was enough to feed the two of us.We were in and out of there in under an hour. Good option for lunch or dinner if you're in the area.TIPS!- Park in the multistory garage across the street. I recommend walking across the sky bridge (located on the 3rd floor of the garage), as this leads you directly to the restaurant. Fog Harbor provides validation for 1 hour of parking.- You can hop on the online Yelp waitlist to avoid a long wait, BUT you have to be within 1 mile of the restaurant to join."
Logan N.,5 star rating,"Jun 27, 2024","I give this place 5 stars not because the food is Michelin quality, but it's a great casual place for a family meal. My kids loved it. BREAD AND BUTTER: warm sourdough bread with butter at its finest. CLAM CHOWDER: you have to order it because it's what you do in SF. It's creamy and probably loaded with half and half, butter, or both. Regardless, my family devoured it. SEARED AHI TUNA: I wished I'd order 2 of these dishes. It was light which was needed to cut through the heavy clam chowder. The flavors are Asian influence. CRAB CAKES:  good but I just don't know how to appreciate a good crab cake. Maybe I'm just not a fan of crab cakes.OCTOPUS: so good!"
Desiree W.,4 star rating,"Jul 20, 2024",Pros: Nicely decorated Great views of the waterA lot of windows to utilize the natural light instead of overhead lightsCandles were brought to the table around sunset...loved itDrinks were amazing my favorite was the lipstick lemon drop. The black raspberry liqueur helped to elevate the lemon drop. Great combo of sour and sweet. I also had the Alcatraz Escape which was good too. The Biscotti cheesecake-chef's kissThe waiter was excellent. I forgot his name but he is from Brazil. He recommended the lemon drop and dessert. He was attentive to us and our needs as we had small children with us.  He also chased us down when we left some items at the table. Cons: The bathrooms that sat in the middle of the waiting area and the bar can use some sprucing. It didn't flow with the look of the restaurant. The restaurant gives a high end vibe but the restrooms were giving fast food. The fried scallops had no flavor. The batter should have been seasoned. I enjoyed my seafood platter but the aftertaste of ocean water or harbor water I didn't like and I felt the noodles were unnecessary. The wait timeOverall: I would go again
Erica H.,5 star rating,"Aug 24, 2024",Jose was our server and he did a fantastic job.  He's quick and very professional.  The food was delicious.
Getin M.,5 star rating,"Jul 26, 2024","We went there twice during our recent trip to San Francisco, it's that good! The crab cakes were all crab and no filler, simply delicious. Also had a cup of their incredible clam chowder. The swordfish was fresh and prepared with chimchurri sauce for the veggies and potatoes, and a delicious pesto aioli on the swordfish. Would totally recommend. The seared scallops and crab risotto, to die for, but very rich, a good dish to share. The lobster roll was fantastic. Got Caesar salad instead of the fries it came with, and the salad was great! Fog Harbor fish house is a gem down at fisherman's wharf. Will visit again when back in SF."
Benson W.,3 star rating,"Apr 1, 2024","Came on a random weekday at sunset and was surprised to see it so packed. Views of the bay are definitely better during the day.Served by bongjovi for the night and he was fantastic.Good seafood overall if you want a taste of  San Francisco. Calamari is definitely top tier, one of the best I've had at any restaurant. I understand it is a seafood restaurant but wanted to try their burger and yes, it was a bad idea. Also the seafood risotto(not sure, I don't see it on menu but check picture ), rice was undercooked way more than usual.I'm not a big fan of seafood but there are occasions that wow me and this was not one of them. Drinks weren't the best, I basically had to shotgun it. Also pretty expensive but understandable."
Ramona G.,5 star rating,"Mar 4, 2024","Dang! Fog Harbor has a whopping 10,000+ reviews! That's a lot!I've had Fog Harbor Fish House bookmarked for a couple of years now, and I finally had the chance to visit the last week of December. My cousin was visiting and we had just done an Alcatraz Tour. I was checking my bookmarks and realized that Fog Harbor wasn't too far away. There was a short wait since we came in the late afternoon.The restaurant is located on the top floor of Pier 39. There's a nice view of SF Bay. It's a tourist restaurant, but I like those types of places.We shared a plate of their Seared Scallop & Crab Risotto $39 which was delicious. We also got a platter of their Calamari $17 which was also great. Our server was really friendly, I forgot his name, but he said he was originally from Hawaii. Super nice guy.Great place to get some seafood at Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf."
Darrel K.,4 star rating,"Mar 17, 2024","We had dinner here on a busy weekday evening when I thought it was going to be a tourist trap, but it turned out to be very nice and classy.  Our wait was minimal and we got seated by the window, which would've had a great view if it weren't at night.  The food was good and the portions were generous enough for two people.  That clam chowder is definitely something I'd go back for again!  It was a big bread bowl and a little soup.  Fried fish and calamari were good since I hadn't had them in a while.  Coming back to the bay always brings back memories of when I lived here!  People say it's gone downhill, but I only saw some vacant storefronts and closed businesses.  There's still the same vibe and energy and it hasn't lost its charm.  It's just like 'San Francisco' by Scott McKenzie"
B-Rad K.,5 star rating,"Sep 1, 2024","Came to Fog Horn for dinner. Our server, Denis, (not Dennis the Menace,) is a friendly chap. We couldn't figure out where which country he was originally from. Sounds like a mix of Portuguese, Italian and Russian, but after a 3 attempts, we figured out where he was from! Take a guess... it was a pleasure having him as our server!"
Laurie S.,4 star rating,"Mar 28, 2024","Our family stopped by for a light dinner here on a Thursday evening. Instant main positive...we were quoted a 15-20 min wait, and it was even a few minutes before when we got our table. Our server, Shawn was very accommodating and attentive. The bread was enjoyed by all at the table. Kids really enjoyed their food-pasta and a cheeseburger. Also ordered at the table was a double espresso, clam chowder in a bread bowl, a mixed green salad, and a side of fingerling potatoes & grilled veggies in oil and garlic. Other than an incorrect salad being brought out, then mine finally coming out quite a bit later, everything was fantastic. They did automatically remove my salad from the bill without us even request it, because the majority of our meal was finished, but I did get to take it home. But honestly, got super full on my lovely made to order veggies, absolutely delish!Seating: They have tables, booths, and the bar available. It was very busy, and there were smiles all around. Amazing views of the bay from basically any seat in the house.Food: Flavorful, ample portions, and not overpriced at all. There is a nice variety of seafood, meat, pasta, salads, beverages, and more.Would definitely come on back when I'm in the area!"

Chris J.,5 star rating,"Aug 31, 2024","Exceptional Dining Experience with Stellar Service by Jorge! I recently had the pleasure of dining at Fog Harbor Fish House, and I must say, the experience was nothing short of outstanding. The moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm welcome, setting the tone for the evening. The ambiance is delightful, with stunning views of the waterfront that perfectly complement the fresh, coastal-themed decor. What truly made the evening memorable, however, was the exceptional service provided by our waiter, Jorge. From the start, Jorge's professionalism and friendly demeanor stood out. He was attentive without being intrusive, ensuring our glasses were always full and that we had everything we needed. His knowledge of the menu was impressive--he offered insightful recommendations that truly enhanced our dining experience. We started with the award winning clam chowder, which was creamy and flavorful, followed by the whole Dungeness crab that were perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, cooked to perfection! Throughout the meal, Jorge checked in at just the right moments, making sure we were enjoying everything. His genuine passion for the food and his commitment to providing top-notch service were evident, and it made all the difference to our dining experience. To top it all off, Jorge recommended the Tiramisu and Apple Crisp a la Mode for dessert, and it was the perfect ending to a fantastic meal--refreshing, tangy, and with just the right amount of sweetness. Overall, Fog Harbor Fish House offers not only exquisite seafood but also an atmosphere of warmth and hospitality. If you're looking for a memorable dining experience, ask for Jorge--you won't be disappointed!"
Kim T.,5 star rating,"Mar 27, 2024","I was taken here for dinner for my birthday and it's located in Pier 39! It's nice to walk around and visit the boutique shops before grabbing food to eat. The restaurant is big and has large windows to look at the boats and water. We sat at the booth next to the bar and had a nice view. The staff were friendly despite being very busy. For appetizers, we got mussel fries and a caesar salad. I thought it was funny how the salad was just lettuce uncut. We loved the sweet, creamy sauce for the mussel fries! For our mains, we got the crab risotto and seafood penne. The crab risotto had scallops and there was also a pesto sauce on top. The food was steaming hot and delicious! I would definitely come back when I'm in the area."

We also saw the bridge and a beautiful sunset. As for the food we tried the clam chowder bowl and the sourdough bread was sooo delicious! I loved the clam chowder since it had potatoes and chunks of clam. So tasty! For the mains we ordered the lobster tails and the scallop and crab risotto. The risotto was rich and had some crab chunks. The scallop was cooked nicely and the lobster of course was delicious! I even like the green beans. Our server was excellent, super attentive, polite, and professional. Definitely would come back here. Everything was wonderful!"

Service was quick and efficient. The steamed clams were my favorite. Their signature clam chowder in a bread bowl was a little too thick for my taste. It was more like gravy than soup. The fried calamari was light and well breaded. The mussels with fries was delicious and mussels were fresh. The fried scallops was tasty but small. Everything was a bit on the heavy side on flavors but good for the normal palette."
Rachel C.,2 star rating,"Feb 29, 2024","It happens occasionally when I get excited over Yelp leading the way to a great restaurant with raving reviews, only to be disappointed. The good news is that we were able to get a seat quickly through the Yelp app.  The bad news is everything else fell flat.  It was our least favorite experience of our entire trip. Food was just ok. Very bland, lacking anything other than grease flavor. Server was just ok. Not very personable.  Ambiance was just ok. Beautiful front entry only to be jammed in the back at a dirty table. I don't know, this is such a gem of a spot on the Wharf and maybe we just totally caught them on an off night."

We were also able to get a military discount on our bill! Highly recommend coming here for lunch or dinner or just to get a great view."

Idalia D.,1 star rating,"Aug 27, 2024",I only ate here because my son wanted lobster. His lobster was so small it was hilarious. My wife and I split a chicken Caesar salad and fried fish and chips. First off our waiter was not friendly. I ask for a second plate that I never got. They serve you water with no ice so the water is warm. I had to ask for ice. My bill was over $100 and it was not worth it. I would have been happy with a street vendor. I don't recommend this place. Zero stars

It was so good, a few bites in we both confessed that we should've opted for the bowl (instead of just a cup). They also have a bread bowl option.Reservations are advised, unless you opt to sit at either of their bars, where seating is first-come. We opted to dine at the casual end of the restaurant, which is more of an oyster bar style of atmosphere. There's a bar inside there as well."

There was a wait upon arrival but I only waited 10 minutes and everyone else seemed to moving through the list quickly. My server greeted me within a few min and I honestly can't say that my service was good or bad. I'm still trying to label my server and/or my service and I just can't. He didn't seem thrilled to be at work that day but was efficient enough. The food was both great and mediocre. The clam chowder with crab added was fantastic! The swordfish was just okay but the veggies it was served with were some of the best I've ever had. I enjoyed my meal so much that I came back for dinner a second night."

Restaurant interior was warm, cozy and the views of the bay were perfect, even on an overcast day. Food was soooo delicious!

My party ordered various food from their menu including the shrimp brochette, shellfish platter, seared scallop and crab risotto, crispy calamari, and mussel fries. For drinks, I got the hibiscus brut. Everything we got was a 10/10. The food was so delicious and reasonably priced. Their service was phenomenal. I would recommend others to come try out this restaurant if you're in the area or visiting SF. Their mussel fries are a must-have!"

Christine D.,5 star rating,"Jun 3, 2024","Took family to Pier 39 to see the sea lions and stopped by Fog Harbor Fish House for a ""light lunch."" We ordered steamed clams, mussel fries, fish and chips, and several bowls of clam chowder. The meal was only light in the sense that we all shared so no one ate a whole plate by themselves. Everything was delicious, and service was great. We were seated immediately upon arriving at noon on the weekend, but just a few minutes later, a waitlist had started."

Betty C.,5 star rating,"Jun 3, 2024",This place is always busy but worth it.  We were seated at a table with a lovely view outside.  The tables aren't crammed together and the waitstaff was attentive without hovering.  There was already a bottle of water on the table.  Our food was tasty and cooked to the appropriate temperature without being overcooked.  I could have sat there all day but the sea lions were calling me!
David L.,5 star rating,"Feb 29, 2024","I came to Fog Harbor since it's one of the most rated restaurants in SF and I'm glad I checked it out. They have a wide variety of seafood as well as steaks, salad, and sandwiches. There was something for everyone at my company's dinner and everything was good overall. FoodI ordered a special steak with crab meat layered on top and it was excellent. The steak was cooked well and was juicy and tender. I loved that the crab meat was all on top so that I did not have to peel anything at all. The mashed potatoes was creamy and super good. The greens were also sautéed well. For table appetizers we got the red chili garlic shrimp, salad, and ceviche from the special menu. The red chili garlic shrimp is kind of spicy but I would recommend it! For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu and the dessert duo. I liked the tiramisu since it's one of my favorite dishes, but they were both delicious and sweet. AtmosphereThe restaurant is located on Pier 39 so you can get a good view of the bay during the day. Casual or fancy wear. The interior was nice and there's a good mix of booth or table seating, as well as outside seating. The noise level was not too loud and we had a good company dinner here. PricingPricing is average for a seafood restaurant and is actually nice if you pay to dine in. I expected to pay more since this is SF (I'm from Seattle) and spot on the pier but overall not too pricey. ServiceService was excellent and the server was able to make good recommendations for the table. Food came out quickly and everything was to order. OtherLocated on the second floor of Pier 39 so be sure to look up and at my picture of the entrance. There is paid parking I think but my group just took a Lyft there. Great view and also things to do around."
Tanaka C.,3 star rating,"Jul 20, 2024","Came back for lunch today and brought Mom and another Sister, totally NOT the same experience. Our server Daniela could NOT be so bothered and it showed. Drastically different from the attentive service we received from Jeremy. The food was good overall but Mom ordered fish and chips with garlic fries which were served cold and the second batch tasted like they were reheated and were hard. She absolutely loved the fish though. Brother ordered the lobster tails which he enjoyed and even raved about the vegetables which accompanied. One of my sisters got the lobster roll and salad which she enjoyed but said there was a tad too much butter. My other Sister and I ordered the seared scallops with lobster risotto and I would ordered this again and again. Unfortunately, my first dish was served just somewhat warm which is a huge irritant to me. The problem was remedied but this, coupled with Moms fries and the lackluster service received, it was like I was in a different place. Even the bread was different, NOT served HOT as it was with Jeremy and today didn't even have that strong sourdough taste. Disappointing to drive across the bridge, have to deal with parking and not receive at least the same level of service we just received not one month ago."
Teresa B.,4 star rating,"Aug 25, 2024","Great ambience and delicious food. We had the cioppino, grilled salmon and snapper, shrimp brochettes, yummy clam chowder with fresh baked rolls. Watching the seals swim in and out of the marina was an added bonus."
Salam A.,4 star rating,"Jul 29, 2024","I was thoroughly impressed with this restaurant as I definitely expected it to be a tourist trap since it's located right on the pier. We waited about 25 minutes in total - I would recommend adding yourself to the yelp waiting list before you arrive to the restaurant to reduce the wait time. We got a  table right next to the window with a gorgeous view of the sea lions and the water. I ordered the clam chowder and caesar salad - I really enjoyed the clam chowder although I wish it came out hotter. The caesar salad was alright, probably wouldn't order again. The best part of the experience was our server Jimmy, he was super attentive and incredibly welcoming. He recommended that we get the biscoff cheesecake and I am not exaggerating when I say it's one of the best desserts I've had in a while. I was honestly blown away by it and would go back just for that!!"
Lee K.,4 star rating,"May 22, 2024","At Fog Harbor, our party experienced great food, service, and views. We made our reservation conveniently via Yelp and we were seated right on time. The reservation confirmation let us know that we could have 1 hour of free parking at the Pier 39 garage with validation. We all opted for the cioppino and agreed that was exceptionally good.  With cioppino, some places prop up the seafood on a bed of pasta, but here they serve 100% seafood and a good amount at that.  The sauce was so good I would have licked the bowl if no one was looking. We also shared a large bowl of New England clam chowder and we're glad we did.  It was excellent, but so rich that it was plenty for us.  We added some of the cioppino sauce to the chowder to spruce it up and tone down the creaminess.  It was perfect.One nit with restaurant - They add to the bill a 5% SF mandated fee for employees which is fine... but in the bill, they tally up the subtotal, tax, and the 5% fee and then suggest tips of 18% to 25% on top of all that.  This tipping thing is really getting out of hand!"
Phil R.,5 star rating,"Feb 19, 2024","A not so subtle WOW!!!!  Could not have been more pleased with this choice in our quick drop-in for a couple nights along The Embarcadero!  Looked up top rated places to eat after a morning tour of Alcatraz and Yelp took us here.  5 stars for all of it; service, food, atmosphere, view, table settings and oh yes.... Service and food.   Crab crab crab for us and we were not disappointed!  Crab roll, crab and avocado Caesar salad, crab topped cup of chowder.... All spot on!!! Sourdough bread roll and blue cheese garlic bread too!!  We were fortunate to be seated without a reservation and super stoked to get a seat along the windows looking out to Alcatraz!  Place is epic and highly recommend!!! We will return when we return!!"
Kady L.,3 star rating,"Dec 28, 2023","Decided to try Fog Harbor as my first restaurant meal after touching down in San Francisco for vacation. I was a bit turned around at first, but realized the restaurant is located on the second floor of Pier 39. I made a reservation through Yelp on a Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. and only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. I could see Alcatraz in the distance from my table, which was pretty cool!I ordered the Clam Chowder in a ""Fresh House Baked Sourdough Bread Bowl"" ($14) and the Cioppino ($41) to share with company, as well as a Fort Point Villager IPA ($9). We were served 2 pieces of yummy complimentary bread to start. Next was the clam chowder, which I thought was average. However, I really enjoyed the cioppino and the spicy bread that came with it. The cioppino had crab, fish, shrimp, scallops, clams, and mussels.Unfortunately, I was repeatedly asked if I was done only 20 minutes after being served the cioppino. Being rushed really put a damper on the meal and made me uncomfortable, so I paid quickly and took the rest of the meal to go. Not likely to return, but glad I gave it a try."
monica c.,3 star rating,"Jul 28, 2024","Came back to San Francisco where I decided to revisit the restaurant. It's not very often that I write negative reviews, but my visit this second time around was a disappointment. The service was very slow which I'm usually patient with considering how busy the restaurant is. First, our waiter never offered us bread and butter. We arrived about the same time as the table next to ours and they didn't get their bread and butter either. Other tables got theirs. Then after our appetizers arrived, my husband decided to request for the bread and butter himself, but it still never came. For one of the appetizers, we ordered a lobster bisque in a regular bowl and it came in a sourdough bread bowl. We told the staff that this was incorrect. He said ""let me check"" and never came back. As expected, the lobster bisque was charged to our receipt so we had to correct that as well. Food this time around was okay in my opinion. We ordered the baked oysters. Flavor was definitely there . It just came out a little sloppy. My daughter got the poké which was pretty bland and could use some extra sauce. I got the half lobster with stuffed crab which wasn't too great either. Barely any meat and tasted dry. I also got tired of the stuffed crab. My husband probably got the best plate which was a half Dungeness crab with pasta. Very buttery and garlicky which made it taste great. I took some of the butter in his pasta to eat with my lobster. The last thing is the soda. My husband kept asking for refills. Sometimes our waiter would take a while to get it for him or sometimes he would forget and my husband would have to ask again. The overall experience from beginning to end made me sad that I spent so much money on the food here and there were multiple things that went wrong during our dinner."
Vivian Y.,5 star rating,"Feb 17, 2024","I'm shocked I haven't reviewed Fog Harbor before because as a native, this is one of my favorite restaurants to take visitors to experience a taste of SF. Yes, it's in the touristy Fishermen's Wharf area but the food and service are good and it gives the impression of SF I think most people think of. My go-to dishes:- crab and spinach dip - this was a bit of a miss this time- seafood linguine - swapped penne for linguine and this was amazing. I love all the fresh seafood in the dish and the balance of the flavors. - seared scallop and crab risotto - probably my favorite dish here. The crab risotto is cooked to a perfect al dente with amazing flavor and perfectly components with the seared scallops. One disappointment was that the scallops weren't evenly seared this time. Still a highly recommended dish though. - mixed grill is always solid. It's simple and yet done right. Perfect if you want to taste fresh seafood at its most natural flavor."
Kimmy J.,5 star rating,"Jul 27, 2024","Had a wonderful meal here! We had reservations and arrived about 10 minutes early, they did say to come back at the time of our reservation. The place is packed and they ask you to leave baby strollers outside which made us a bit nervous since our stroller is also our car seat and if it got stolen we wouldn't have been able to fly back home without buying another car seat from somewhere. But this wasn't the only restaurant that asked us to do it. I guess they are all pretty cramped for space. Our waiter was fantastic and the food was good! What made it stand out though, was the view from our table. We would pick this restaurant again over similar ones for that reason. The clam chowder was really good! I preferred the bread bowl at Crab House but the fish and chips my husband said was better here. The crab addition to my salad was so good. We got a chicken strips kids meal for our toddler and they were actually amazing. Can't go wrong here it seems! We would absolutely return on a future trip!"
Melanie K.,5 star rating,"Jul 29, 2024",My first time dining here and the food and service was amazing.Our server Luis was very friendly and attentive and on top of everything.

Lei W.,5 star rating,"May 23, 2024",Had a bowl of clam chowder and a kids grilled salmon.  Made reservations ahead of time.  This is my third trip here to Fog Harbor.  I would have liked more water.  The food and view was great.  I'll be back.
Russel R.,5 star rating,"May 23, 2024",At Fisherman's Wharf and stopped for a drink and appetizer.  Good selection of wine and beer.  Decided on crab dip appetizer and drinks at the bar. Great service.
Fiona T.,4 star rating,"Jan 15, 2024","This place is packed! Make sure to put your name down for a table. My wait was about 45 minutes at 8pm on a Tuesday. The inside is very big with lots of seating styles: booth, chairs, bar, elevated seating etc.Service was pretty slow but it's a very large restaurant so I understand. My food came before the drinks. It took over 15 minutes for drinks to come out.Cant go wrong with a strawberry lemonade and an old fashion for my boyfriend. The $17 steamed clams were good.$8 clam chowder was okay.The $25 clam linguini is hit or miss. My boyfriend loved it because he could enjoy the subtle flavors. I on the other hand thought it was bland and couldn't appreciate the subtle flavors. We had a snack prior to dinner which I regret because the desserts looked yummy! Might come back just for the dessert next time.I'm stuck between a 3 and a 4 for this spot. I think I didn't order the right things this time for my preferences."
