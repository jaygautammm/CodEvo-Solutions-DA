Elfan M.,4 star rating,"Jul 22, 2024",Great food! Love the location however is pretty loud. I recommend the clam chowder! Service was on point!
Aly L.,5 star rating,"Aug 31, 2024","Our food and service was great!! Jorge was our server and he made our party feel extra special with recommendations and his attentiveness. We ordered the grilled lobster and the risotto, yum!! The drawn butter leans towards the salty side, but is great in moderation. We'd definitely return."
Sky R.,4 star rating,"Aug 31, 2024","As many of the great long lasting restaurants (Neptune's, Aliotti's, Fisherman's Grotto, Castagna's) located at San Francisco' Fisherman's Wharf have closed since COVID, we were looking for a new restaurant and discovered Fog Harbor. We shared a Caesar Salad and Chappino which was plenty for two for.  Although the staff was very friendly we had to ask multiple times for refills and Salt&Pepper.   It seemed like they were rushing people  through to turn tables quickly.  We probably would return if we were in the area again, but not a destination restaurant."
Dmitry D.,4 star rating,"Aug 30, 2024",So the view is amazing we sat right in the window over looking Alcatraz beat seats ever.Now the service wasn't the worst but when your waiter doesn't write stuff down and you have big order not sure how good they are but ours wasn't perfect . He forgot a dish we ordered and really wanted to try .The food wasn't bad flavored but the pasta was to oily and greasy.The seafood tasted good but it was smaller size shrimp and craps than what I expected for the price and the crabs were over cooked and dry.The bread was really good like wow good.And over wasn't the worst but when you go to a place looking forward to the dish that wasn't made for you it sucks .
Catherine B.,5 star rating,"Aug 26, 2024","Fog Harbor Fish House seems like a quintessential part of SF and Pier 39. It was the first and last touristy restaurant I visited in my three years in the Bay. It's a restaurant that requires a reservation and one that you can easily take visiting parents to. I've been three times and tried most of their menu items; here are the highlights:- best clam chowder I've had in SF (not that I'm an expert on soup but it's well seasoned without being salty which is rare to my tastebuds) (since the restaurant serves free sourdough, I recommend getting a regular large instead of the ""iconic"" yet impractical bread bowl although I've ordered it one too many times haha)- another iconic part of this restaurant is the huge dessert platter with the clay replicas of all their desserts (it's fun to choose and so hard not to ask for one of everything sigh) (creme brulee, lava cake, and biscoff cheesecake were all solid desserts)- all of their fish dishes are above average (in order of yumminess, I've had their seafood boil, crab cakes, steamed crab, calamari, fish and chips, mahi mahi, and cioppino)- all of their pastas are pretty average (since it's such a huge restaurant, you can't expect much care in how they cook the pasta, so if you want to order one, I'd switch out penne for linguine to preserve the texture somewhat) (also I thought their oil pastas were higher quality than their tomato based ones)Overall, it's pricy but a good experience and my parents were willing to return (which is a huge win when you have Asian parents iykyk)"
Babu G.,5 star rating,"Aug 31, 2024","This restaurant requires a reservation or be prepared for a long wait! It's extremely popular at the pier so I'd recommend making a reservation. Also if u can't eat seafood they don't have much options so be prepared! This place has amazing seafood dishes if u are a seafood lover! All of their appetizers was great and the main entree we got was also good. The server took care of us really well and constantly checked up on us. The ambience inside was also really beautiful, we sat at the edge of the restaurant overlooking the ocean. We got to watch the sunset while having our dinner. Make sure to come during sunset for the best experience!"
Tina V.,4 star rating,"Aug 27, 2024",Can't go wrong with clam chowder in a bread bowl when in SF. It came out fast and piping hot. It had a good amount of clams in the soup and definitely hit the spot! Service was really good. Nice place to chill at.
Johnna G.,5 star rating,"Aug 3, 2024","We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday right at 11:00AM and were seated right away. This spot filled up quickly! So I'm glad we got there when we did. We were seated at a bay front table and were able to see Alcatraz. Nice view, especially since the fog was starting to burn off. The service was great. Prompt and friendly. The menu is great and it was hard to choose. We ended up ordering a few things and sharing. We ordered two appetizers: Spicy Shrimp and the Ahi Tuna stack. Both were good. The spicy shrimp was spicy, but flavorful. We also ordered the Crab and Avocado Cesar salad, which was delicious, and the Shrimp Borchette, also delicious and huge portion. We aren't from the area and due to location, we were a little worried it was a tourist trap, but it wasn't. Definitely good and did not disappoint."
