Oyster comes with only vinaigrette, without even a spoon. Forget oyster folk. No hot sauce or cocktail sauce. Oyster liquid is drained off. Asked for horse radish and spoon. They suggest to pour vinaigrette over oyster. Mind you this is not eating in a farmers market. Horse radish came, but is canned not fresh. Overpowering. For the price. Not worth it. Then the clam chowder. Just a cup, no oyster cracker with it. Asked for cracker, waiter brought 2 stale saltine crackers, said all he could find. . the stale cracker with soggy texture ruined the chowder all together. The cioppino  - a SF classic - is flavorless - lack of salt and acidity. while the fish is fresh, the broth tasted like canned tomato sauce and it didn\\'t come with a lemon. As former SF residents (moved to the South Bay) we were looking forward to try out these \"standard\" dishes again in a new restaurant and this is a HUGE disappointment. Our waiter - while came to check us a few times. need training on what should come with these dishes - or the kitchen staff needs basic training.

       "  'A Pier 39 restaurant. It is located at Pier 39, which is the Times Square of SF. A ton of tourists, tourist attractions and prob some tourist traps. I read so many great reviews of this place that I tried it out for my bday dinner. I do advise making reservations, they were really busy and crowded on a Sunday around 730pm. I had a table for 1 and still waited a short while for a table.I was served bread and water before receiving the menu, once my waitress introduced herself, I ordered appetizers. The calamari and the mussel fries. I was so excited to order based on the pictures, but everything that looks good isn\\'t necessarily good. The calamari arrived lukewarm, it wasn\\'t prepared fresh and if it was that means it sat there waiting for someone to bring it to me. I am going to say it wasn\\'t fresh because once I ordered it didn\\'t take an exceptionally long time to get my food. The mussels were ok, the broth was flavorful and the fries were basic fries with garlic sauce on top( terrible fries). I wouldn\\'t order either dish again.As for service, the waitress was seen bouncing from table to table, but was attentive as she could be with the crowd. It is a decent place for a date night, but I suggest venturing AWAY from Pier 39.I was looking and craving that foodie experience that so many rave about in SF and this just didn\\'t work for me. I was later told \" the locals never eat at Pier 39!\" Same thing I was told my first visit to NYC'],\n",

       "  'Fog Harbor Fish House seems like a quintessential part of SF and Pier 39. It was the first and last touristy restaurant I visited in my three years in the Bay. It\\'s a restaurant that requires a reservation and one that you can easily take visiting parents to. I\\'ve been three times and tried most of their menu items; here are the highlights:- best clam chowder I\\'ve had in SF (not that I\\'m an expert on soup but it\\'s well seasoned without being salty which is rare to my tastebuds) (since the restaurant serves free sourdough, I recommend getting a regular large instead of the \"iconic\" yet impractical bread bowl although I\\'ve ordered it one too many times haha)- another iconic part of this restaurant is the huge dessert platter with the clay replicas of all their desserts (it\\'s fun to choose and so hard not to ask for one of everything sigh) (creme brulee, lava cake, and biscoff cheesecake were all solid desserts)- all of their fish dishes are above average (in order of yumminess, I\\'ve had their seafood boil, crab cakes, steamed crab, calamari, fish and chips, mahi mahi, and cioppino)- all of their pastas are pretty average (since it\\'s such a huge restaurant, you can\\'t expect much care in how they cook the pasta, so if you want to order one, I\\'d switch out penne for linguine to preserve the texture somewhat) (also I thought their oil pastas were higher quality than their tomato based ones)Overall, it\\'s pricy but a good experience and my parents were willing to return (which is a huge win when you have Asian parents iykyk)'],\n",

However, I was surprised on my first and most recent visit and I found the food to be absolutely delicious.Our visit got off on a rocky start. I made reservations for our party of 8 a month ago. We arrived on time, but had to wait for 40 MINUTES as they were clearing the tables. This was crazy to me because I heard them quote a walk-in party of 7 one hour wait. So...what was my reservation for?This was during a busy Saturday summertime lunch so I understand it was busy, but the expectations need to be improved. Eventually we were seated and our server was excellent - friendly, funny, efficient. The menu said \"best clam chowder in San Francisco\" so, of course, we HAD to order the chowder. It was excellent...and the best clam chowder I\\'ve had in Bay Area. (Get the bread bowl with it! You won\\'t regret it)I also ordered a very delicious cioppino and mussel fries, which were literally just mussels with fries on top but it was quite tasty.I will be back...but maybe on a not-so-busy day.'],\n",

Any seafood on the pier is going to come at a premium, but the prices and experience here are on par or above any others I have had in the area, and I've tried quite a few. Even the wine prices are reasonable, and in such a touristy area that can be hard to come by. My partner loves to eat a whole crab for her birthday and this is the fourth year we've tried a new spot, and we have a winner. The whole crab comes with excellent potatoes and vegetables, and the clam chowder we added on has just the right amount of smoky bacon flavor to accent the rich oceanic flavor of the chowder. My cioppino was excellent with a pretty thick and flavorful broth with ample quality fish, shrimp, scallops, and mussels for every bite. Not to mention the perfectly fired calamari appetizer that comes with a delightfully garlic-heavy tartar sauce that's simply divine.

We were seated and had a nice view of harbor and Golden Gate Bridge. Our kind server was Jorge & he was spectacular and had a very nice personality! He is a Hapa like me, and what was really cool is that he could speak Spanish to my husband and Japanese to me. We ordered following appetizers : 1. Fried calamari with a perfect crisp, and very tender & fresh with lemon aoli dip and fried jalapeños and onions (double yum) 5/5!2. Poke (5/5) super yum and fresh and good flavor. It came with these crispy won tons with cubed avocado, mango, etc w/delicious creamy wasabi dressing & keep in mind we aren\\'t huge wasabi fans and we loved it ! Also, there was a seaweed garnish that added a wonderful taste. Meals as follows: 1. Small cup of clam chowder for me and bowl for my hubby. Super tasty flavor, thick and perfect amount of clams etc. almost got crab added but glad I didn\\'t. It was so perfect! I got the small cup with the complimentary yummy, warm, sour dough bread with butter-5/5! My most fav clam chowder I have ever had in my life- really! 2. Kids meal :chicken tenders and fries (5/5) super yummy 3. Kids meal: cheeseburger fries (5/5) super good !Drinks: Pinot noir and modelo (5/5)Desert: blonde brownie desert with vanilla icecreamw/whipped cream (4/5) It could have been less \"nutty\" and no nuts @ all! I think there were way too many nuts. Still good ! I didn\\'t get to choose, so.. lolNext time, I would select the caramel apple crumble desert with vanilla ice cream as the server suggested it was his fav ! Overall, 5/5 & will def return again!!

       "  'San Francisco is expensive, tourist traps are more expensive, now that the obvious is out of the way, let\\'s get into it: I\\'ve gone to Fog Harbor twice now, once for a work lunch and once with my family for dinner and I\\'ll break down both experiences. For our work lunch, we were able to snag a table for 10 at noon on a Wednesday, no problem. We were seated by a window on a beautiful sunny day. Service was great. It was my first time here, and honestly just because it\\'s on the Pier, my expectations were extremely low and I was shocked how good it was! We got a round of apps for the table including the crispy calamari and crab dip. The calamari had crispy jalapenos and this tangy lemon aioli. I would come back for this alone and a beer, it was very good. You also can\\'t go wrong with some warm bread and butter. I had a seafood penne for my entree and paired it was a ginger lemonade. Let me tell you, they did not skimp on the seafood. Super impressive, for $29 I was loaded up with a ton of shrimp, clams, and mussels. I was overly full and plenty left over. I also really enjoyed the ginger lemonade, a great NA option. The creme brulee was a little disappointing, as it didn\\'t have that great crack sensation we are always looking for.Now for the dinner experience with my family:I tried to reserve a table, in person, the day before because on Yelp reservations, it only allows for tables up to 6. I was told I couldn\\'t make a reservation in person and refer to the app and just leave a note that it was going to be 7 people. This was a little annoying but minor detail. It was a busy Thursday night and we got seated right at the time of our reservation which was 6:30 PM. We had the best waiter! My parents don\\'t speak English and luckily, he could communicate with them in Spanish which was so awesome! My 80 year old dad gets nervous going to these \"fancy shmancy\" like places, so it\\'s so nice seeing him comfortable. Obviously, we got the calamari, delic! We opted for a seafood tower for two, poke, and I tried the clam linguini this time. Loved the seafood options, would pass on the linguini next time, it was a little bland. Overall, it is a tourist trap but if you\\'re spending the day on the Pier or Fisherman\\'s Wharf, it\\'s a great place to dine in, if you\\'re looking for something not as casual.'],\n",

We took an Uber to Pier 39, eager to try the restaurant that came so highly recommended.Tommy savored every bite of his swordfish topped with a rich pesto aioli, perfectly accompanied by roasted peppers, red onions, zucchini, and fingerling potatoes, served with a delectable chimichurri sauce. It\\'s clear that Tommy has an incredible palate for great food.George Ripley and I enjoyed the Fish & Chips, featuring beer-battered fresh cod and a side of crisp cole slaw. The dish was exceptional, elevating a classic favorite to new heights with its perfectly crispy batter and tender, flavorful fish.Adding to the delightful evening, George Ripley shared insights from his recent work on two documentaries: \"The 13th Floor Elevators Story\" and \"Slip Inside This House: The Tommy Hall Story.\" It was a night of fantastic food and fascinating conversation.You can read more about Tommy Hall in this 2009 SF Weekly article by Jennifer Maerz:https://www.sfweekly.com/music/a-long-strange-trip/article_0871305a-094e-5327-9a65-999be305d937.html'],\n",

Everything I saw from locals prior to visiting said to skip Pier 39 because it's a tourist trap and there's much better food in other areas of the city. So while this wasn't my first choice, we were close by and decided to visit. Honestly, it gave Red Lobster vibes to me for some reason. I had a hard time selecting something I wanted to eat that day. Ultimately I went with a special dish on the menu, which was the halibut, served over succotash with corn, beans and tomatoes in a beurre blanc. The sauce was very flavorful, the vegetables too, but the halibut lacked flavor to me. It also seemed a bit overcooked. On my next visit I would likely find a local seafood spot outside of the pier. Overall, the staff was friendly and service was good. The food came out fast, and the restaurant has plenty of seating plus beautiful views. We visited at night and since we didn't sit by a window, we didn't have the best view of the pier, but I can understand why it's so popular.\"],\n",

Therefore I kept looking and found \"Fog Harbor Fish House\". I was seen immediately and I\\'m guessing because not too many were lined up to pay the fine dining prices.

       "  \"Exceptional Dining Experience with Stellar Service by Jorge! I recently had the pleasure of dining at Fog Harbor Fish House, and I must say, the experience was nothing short of outstanding. The moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm welcome, setting the tone for the evening. The ambiance is delightful, with stunning views of the waterfront that perfectly complement the fresh, coastal-themed decor. What truly made the evening memorable, however, was the exceptional service provided by our waiter, Jorge. From the start, Jorge's professionalism and friendly demeanor stood out. He was attentive without being intrusive, ensuring our glasses were always full and that we had everything we needed. His knowledge of the menu was impressive--he offered insightful recommendations that truly enhanced our dining experience. We started with the award winning clam chowder, which was creamy and flavorful, followed by the whole Dungeness crab that were perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, cooked to perfection! Throughout the meal, Jorge checked in at just the right moments, making sure we were enjoying everything. His genuine passion for the food and his commitment to providing top-notch service were evident, and it made all the difference to our dining experience. To top it all off, Jorge recommended the Tiramisu and Apple Crisp a la Mode for dessert, and it was the perfect ending to a fantastic meal--refreshing, tangy, and with just the right amount of sweetness. Overall, Fog Harbor Fish House offers not only exquisite seafood but also an atmosphere of warmth and hospitality. If you're looking for a memorable dining experience, ask for Jorge--you won't be disappointed!\"],\n",

My other Sister and I ordered the seared scallops with lobster risotto and I would ordered this again and again. Unfortunately, my first dish was served just somewhat warm which is a huge irritant to me. The problem was remedied but this, coupled with Moms fries and the lackluster service received, it was like I was in a different place.

With cioppino, some places prop up the seafood on a bed of pasta, but here they serve 100% seafood and a good amount at that.  The sauce was so good I would have licked the bowl if no one was looking. We also shared a large bowl of New England clam chowder and we're glad we did.  It was excellent, but so rich that it was plenty for us.  We added some of the cioppino sauce to the chowder to spruce it up and tone down the creaminess.

We were served 2 pieces of yummy complimentary bread to start. Next was the clam chowder, which I thought was average. However, I really enjoyed the cioppino and the spicy bread that came with it. The cioppino had crab, fish, shrimp, scallops, clams, and mussels.Unfortunately, I was repeatedly asked if I was done only 20 minutes after being served the cioppino. Being rushed really put a damper on the meal and made me uncomfortable, so I paid quickly and took the rest of the meal to go. Not likely to return, but glad I gave it a try.'],\n",

The service was very slow which I\\'m usually patient with considering how busy the restaurant is. First, our waiter never offered us bread and butter. We arrived about the same time as the table next to ours and they didn\\'t get their bread and butter either. Other tables got theirs. Then after our appetizers arrived, my husband decided to request for the bread and butter himself, but it still never came. For one of the appetizers, we ordered a lobster bisque in a regular bowl and it came in a sourdough bread bowl. We told the staff that this was incorrect. He said \"let me check\" and never came back. As expected, the lobster bisque was charged to our receipt so we had to correct that as well. Food this time around was okay in my opinion. We ordered the baked oysters. Flavor was definitely there . It just came out a little sloppy. My daughter got the poké which was pretty bland and could use some extra sauce. I got the half lobster with stuffed crab which wasn\\'t too great either. Barely any meat and tasted dry. I also got tired of the stuffed crab. My husband probably got the best plate which was a half Dungeness crab with pasta. Very buttery and garlicky which made it taste great. I took some of the butter in his pasta to eat with my lobster. The last thing is the soda. My husband kept asking for refills. Sometimes our waiter would take a while to get it for him or sometimes he would forget and my husband would have to ask again.

Yes, it's in the touristy Fishermen's Wharf area but the food and service are good and it gives the impression of SF I think most people think of. My go-to dishes:- crab and spinach dip - this was a bit of a miss this time- seafood linguine - swapped penne for linguine and this was amazing. I love all the fresh seafood in the dish and the balance of the flavors. - seared scallop and crab risotto - probably my favorite dish here. The crab risotto is cooked to a perfect al dente with amazing flavor and perfectly components with the seared scallops. One disappointment was that the scallops weren't evenly seared this time. Still a highly recommended dish though. - mixed grill is always solid. It's simple and yet done right. Perfect if you want to taste fresh seafood at its most natural flavor.\"],\n",

The views are unbelievable, making it worth eating here during day or night.The staff service was the highlight of the dining. Our server was very attentive to us, checking in or giving us updates on how the dishes are going, asking if a well done steak wants to be butterflied, asking us if we wanted more bread, and being friendly with the children at the table. It was consistent throughout the service, and we'll aligned to what you expect at a high end seafood restaurant.The food was not bad, with everything being at least a 4/5. The calamari was nicely breaded and seasoned, but I would have loved more of a cook on it. The mixed grill was extremely filling, but slightly under seasoned on the fish (the shrimp was on point though). The linguini had a great taste and plenty of clams to be satisfied. The specials (crab topped NY strip, the crab topped spinach dip) were the best part of the meal.I would absolutely come back here again should I find myself playing tourist in the city!\"],\n",

They definitely just need to work on the flavor of the dish. I hear the clam chowder is what I need to get next time so maybe I will order that and give this place another shot. Service: The service here was honestly meh. Our server wasnt really personable and didnt even make any recommendations. He just asked if we knew what we wanted. Also, I saw that he asked other tables if they wanted dessert and even brought them a tray of selections but he didnt offer us any. I was waiting to see if he was ever going to mention as most restaurants do and he just brought the check. Definitely service could use a bit of work here. Ambiance: The ambiance was very nice!

Not bad at all, but Fog Harbor unfortunately had some bad luck on our end. It had the bad fortune of being our meal right after we ate at an SF institution that's known to have some of the best seafood in the city (and was the freshest seafood we ever tasted).As a result, Fog Harbor's seafood dishes - while still good - didn't quite compare with the freshness level of the other restaurant, which won't be named here.Overall, For Harbor is a great seafood place with good service and a great view of the water. Would highly recommend coming here if you're at Pier 39 - just maybe not right after eating the freshest seafood you've ever tasted.\"],\n",

Luckily, his sister has been here several times and spoke very highly of this restaurant.RESERVATIONS: Recommended! Fog Harbor is top rated on Yelp when you search SF. It's in a prime location therefore we highly suggest making reservations.AMBIANCE: Casual with amazing views of the bay. The restaurant has big glass windows around its entirety overlooking the bay. Even on their patio, they have dividers that give you privacy but you also get beautiful views of the bay and the bridge. MENU/FOOD: They have a large selection of foods as well as a seasonal menu. The average prices were $20-$50 per plate. We each opted for their clam chowder and also for their lobster ravioli, clam linguine with alfredo sauce, and mixed grill. All of these items came in fairly large portions, large enough to share. The clam chowder here is very delicious. Very creamy and loaded with so much clam. They gave complimentary sourdough rolls which complemented the chowder. The clam linguine is also creamy and the linguine is cooked to a perfect al dente. The lobster ravioli was superb. The ravioli skin was soft and held flavorful bites of lobster with ricotta. The lobster tasted so fresh! As for the mixed grill, it was our favorite! We substituted the shrimp for more salmon. The salmon was very tender and the seasoning on the salmon was out of this world. We couldn't get enough of it! The mashed potatoes were very creamy and the grilled vegetables were very refreshing with a hint of lemon. OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Easily one of our top favorite restaurants at SF officially. We understand the high ratings behind Fog Harbor now. The food is outstanding and the service was great. They were very accommodating towards us by opening their patio for us to enjoy a meal with our pug. Even though we were the only party outside, our waitress made sure we were well taken care of. We couldn't stop talking about the amazing food and experience here at Fog Harbor. We will always stop by here anytime we visit SF moving forward!\"],\n",

Their calamari is delicious- it's crispy and tender - not chewy (which is a great sign that it's fresh and made right). Their baked oysters were small on the oysters part but flavorful- still debating whether they are worth $25 for 6. The bacon and cheese added flavor to it so it was delicious. Deducted 0.2 stars for this. Fish and chips - their fish is tender yet crispy and fries were great too. Customer service started off super attentive but disappeared after the food was delivered- we had to get attention to get the check at the end of our meal, but it's not bad. Deducted 0.2 stars for this. Overall- I rate this place 4.6 stars for the reasons listed above. Their champagne is tasty- they carry preseco and Gloria Ferera sparkling, which you can't go wrong with.Parking: the Resturant is  on pier 39 so as you can guess, parking is a nightmare :) General location: inside the Resturant smells a bit fishy, though I didn't deduct any stars for this because I wonder if the location is contributing to the stink, so I will have to try other non seafood restaurants and see if they smell fishy, and will come back to this location and update my review.\"],\n",

We kicked off our meal with the Ahi Tuna Poke, and it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The combination of Sriracha and Wasabi sauce on the mango and tuna was simply amazing! Naturally, we couldn't resist trying their renowned Clam Chowder, and it didn't disappoint. Creamy and flavorful, it lived up to its reputation.Moving on to the mixed grill plate, it was overall enjoyable, although I must admit I wasn't a fan of the sauce they applied to the salmon, cod, and shrimp after grilling. It seemed to overshadow the delightful grilled flavors. However, our experience was redeemed by the outstanding cioppino we ordered. It was truly exceptional, leaving us thoroughly impressed.Having dined at Fog Harbor Fish House before, we can confidently say that it won't be our last visit.

       "  'We\\'re giving FOG HARBOR the TOP Five 5 Star rating based on a few factors.First off, it has to fight the stigma of residing in Pier 39, known by locals in SF as a \"tourist trap\" type location.  It\\'s actually high quality as an experience and the food portions, taste and prices are fair.  We were expecting to be gauged and get sub-part quality being at Pier 39.If this relocated to any other area in SF, it would probably be at the top of many local\\'s lists, especially if parking was easy and traffic wasn\\'t gridlocked to get to.So, if you\\'re a tourist and see this place and worry about it being questionable with so many other choices, the right decision is to look at the menu first and if you see stuff you like, go here and don\\'t roll the dice on other places which may not give you a solid experience as Fog Harbor does and has/had for us.We\\'re locals in SF but came with visiting tourists, and everyone was happy.We had the Clam Chowder and one comment on the table was it wasn\\'t \"Salty\" (a negative would be being salty) and that it was served \"Hot\" (and that\\'s a good trait to be piping hot and allowed to cool down rather than come warm and end up being cold.We had the Halibut, Sole and Swordfish without any complaints and completely empty plates after indulging in the entrees.Yeah, they charge the dreaded \"5% SF Employee Mandate \"Tax\" Surcharge\" which I think all San Francisco restaurants do, on top of the 8.625% sales tax then whatever you end up tipping... so you are leaving paying 30%+ more than the menu list price on everything.  That\\'s more of a comment on the state of San Francisco\\'s policies than anything this restaurant can control or is at any blame for.The service was friendly, fast and accommodating.  They asked about food allergies and tastes/dislikes ahead of ordering, being very conscientious of their customers needs.They give complimentary rolls and butter which is always a huge plus never to be taken for granted.On a weekend night, you can find street parking for under $1 an hour as opposed to parking in the Pier 39 parking structure or paid parking lots.I\\'d recommend this spot to all.'],\n",

       "  \"So yesterday we were doing the tourist thing. We had out of town company from both Texas and Arizona and decided to go to Pier 39. Our usual dinner restaurant on the pier is Pier Market. However, and we usually don't get our dinner recommendations here, but our Texas visitor went into the men's room and overheard two guys talking about how wonderful Fog Harbor was. We looked it up on Yelp and it was 4 1/2 stars, so we decided to give it a try. We were a little apprehensive because the negative reviews were all about the slow service and wait times. But, we were a party of five and seated within five minutes of putting our name in. Kailee came to our table almost immediately and took our drink order. She was very personable and bubbly, and she offered to answer any questions on the menu or give recommendations. She brought drinks back almost immediately, along with a big bottle of water for the table. I asked for her recommendation between the seafood penne or linguine clams. She said she'd go with the penne and I did. Our Arizona guest ordered the linguine clams and Kailee joked that I could just try hers. Appetizers came out very fast... Crab bruschetta, fried calamari, and baked oysters. It was all good, and we would definitely order them again. For my entrée, the seafood penne was excellent. Clams, scallops, prawns, mussels, and fish in a nice red sauce with penne. The chunks of fish were very large, and it all tasted very fresh. My husband and his brother ordered the seared Ahi.  It was a very large piece of Ahi seared lightly on the outside over a bed of rice with edamame surrounding it. It was melt in your mouth tender, and probably some of the best we have tasted. I didn't try the linguine clams, but it must've been very good because this very picky teen ate almost all of it. My daughter ordered the chicken penne pesto and she loved it. The bread rolls they bring are excellent and Kailee was extremely attentive, bringing bottles of water to our table every few minutes as we went through quite a few of them. we would definitely go back to this restaurant in a minute. And, if at all possible, I would request to be seated in Kailee's section as she was great and a lot of fun to joke around with. She also makes excellent recommendations! Thank you, Kailee.\"],\n",
