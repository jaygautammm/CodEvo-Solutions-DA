What is the case against a Punjab cop over which Speaker has summoned DGP?,Kanchan Vasdev,2024-09-03 12:15:57+05:30,"The case against Faridkot Assistant Sub-Inspector Bohar Singh, over which Punjab Assembly Speaker Kultar Singh Sandhwan has summoned DGP Gaurav Yadav, is related to a 2015 FIR of sexual harassment registered against Anantdeep Singh, who has accused the police officer of bribery.

Anantdeep, 38, son of the Congress municipal councillor from ward 2 in Kotkapura in Faridkot district, Surinderpal Kaur, complained to the police on August 20 that ASI Bohar Singh had accepted a bribe for cancelling the FIR against him.

On Monday, Speaker Sandhwan asked DGP Yadav to appear before him on Tuesday with a report on the corruption case against the ASI, registered under section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 and (Amendment Act 2018).

In 2019, Bohar Singh was mukh munshi in the Kotkapura city police station. “I used to get work done from him and he was given his fees. We were close. FIR 162 of 14 Sept 2015 under section 341 (wrongful restraint), 294 (reciting, singing it uttering any obscene song, ballad or words), 354 A (sexual harassment), 354 B (criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC was registered against me. This FIR was cancelled in November 2015. Cancellation report was submitted in court in December 2016. But the complainant refused to agree to the cancellation and the case was sent back to the police station for reinvestigation,” Anantdeep said in his complaint.

Anantdeep told The Indian Express that he did not know the complainant in the case against him. “I was framed during the SAD-BJP government as I have been a Congress worker,” he said.

Anantdeep alleged that Bohar Singh had asked for 1.5 lakh to get the FIR cancelled. “On December 5, 2019, I gave him Rs 50,000 in advance. I promised to give him Rs 50,000 in some days. Then Bohar Singh was transferred out of Kotkapura. I met him in Faridkot several times. In April 2020, I met him again and asked him for help. He demanded Rs 50,000 more. On April 17, 2020, I gave him a cheque of Rs 50,000. Bohar Singh got it encashed. As it was Covid time, he kept on promising me. But he has still not got my work done. I met him 15 days ago again and he demanded Rs 50,000 more from me. I asked him to return my advance but he refused. He is now an ASI. I want action taken against him,” he said.

Pragya Jain, SSP, Faridkot, said on Monday that Bohar Singh was suspended on August 24. Bohar Singh was unavailable for comment as all his phones were switched off.

Anantdeep said that Bohar Singh had been posted at the Kotkapura city police station for seven to eight years before he was transferred to the Faridkot police station in 2020.

Anantdeep said he had three FIRs pending against him. “Another one was about a fight with my neighbour. I do not remember the third one. I will give you the details after checking,” he told The Indian Express.

He said the police had declared him a gangster sometime ago. “At that time, I had only one FIR against me and they declared me a gangster. But I want to tell you that all these are fake cases. I have been framed,” he said.

Congress’s allegation against Speaker

Meanwhile, Congress leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira has alleged that Speaker Sandhwan has a personal score to settle with the ASI, posting online a daily diary report (DDR) from June 13.

“The PC ACT case registered against the ASI is a result of DDR No 015 Ps Sadar Faridkot of 12.6.24 registered against Birinder Singh, brother of Speaker Sandhwan, on the complaint of ASI Bohar for abusing & threatening him,” Khaira wrote on X on Tuesday.

The DDR, which records complaints of non-cognisable offences, was registered at the Faridkot Sadar police station. ASI Bohar Singh had alleged that Sandhwan’s brother had called him and used abusive language. He had threatened to get him transferred to a place where he would not get a drop of water.

“So now it is abundantly clear that it’s purely a matter of personal enmity between the family of Speaker and the said ASI and in no manner a matter of public interest that should have been raked up by the Speaker in Vidhan Sabha ignoring burning issues of Punjab!

“I urge @BhagwantMann to order an impartial inquiry into the whole issue of corruption if any and vindictive actions of the Speaker.

“In the meantime, the Speaker should tender an apology for misleading the house by presenting wrong facts besides raising a matter of personal enmity in the house,” Khaira wrote."
Pink seats: Putting the onus of safety on women,Adya Goyal,2024-09-03 12:11:43+05:30,"On a British Airways flight from London to Delhi in 2021, I had the misfortune of being seated next to two White British men from rural England travelling to India to work on an oil rig project in Vizag. In the beginning, the questions were reasonable: “Where are you from? What do you do? Where do you study?”. After the flight took off, and food and drinks were served — I had my customary apple juice, the men, wine and whiskey — the questions and the situation got worse. As the men got progressively drunker, courtesy questions were replaced by “Do you have a boyfriend?”, “Are your parents forcing you to get married?” and “Don’t they do that in India?” I kept getting elbowed “by mistake”. At some point, the alcohol wore them down and they fell asleep. An airhostess hurried towards me and apologised profusely for the men’s rowdy behaviour citing complaints by other passengers around. I was moved to an alternate seat and comforted with free chocolate and snacks.

This is only one instance of the kinds of harassment women face on a regular basis, whether during travel, at the workplace, on the street, or even in one’s own home. This is why when IndiGo rolled out its new feature that allows women, during web check-in, to see where other women are seated (indicated in pink), I lauded the airline for its initiative.

But after reflecting more deeply, I realised it was not so black-and-white. This move, as espoused by the airline itself, is in line with the company’s #GirlPower campaign. IndiGo has one of the highest percentages of female pilots across the world and boasts of an over 44 per cent workforce that is female. From the outside, the airline is an ally, a champion of women’s empowerment. But at the end of the day, it is a profit-making enterprise. And, its profit-maximising motive is most evident in this move, which has been launched under the guise of “celebrating” women. It exemplifies the notion of what professor Catherine Rottenberg termed “neoliberal feminism”.

In a 2014 article, Rottenberg analysed former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg’s book Lean In and made a case for a new kind of feminism that individualises empowerment: “Neoliberal feminism is predominantly concerned with instating a feminist subject who epitomises ‘self-responsibility,’ and who no longer demands anything from the state or the government, or even from men as a group.” It is the idea that the problem of gender inequality is not structural but individual, and that every woman now can have it all — if only they want it. The onus is thus on women, as the “weaker” sex, to emancipate themselves.

Giving women, in this case, the choice of sitting next to other women, illustrates this fact. Most IndiGo seats are already paid ones, unless you choose to get assigned a seat at random. As yet, there is no additional charge for women to avail the feature of being able to see where other women are seated. But being able to see where one is seated may push more women to pay to pick their seats away from men. This feature then, can be even greater incentive for them to pay their way out of an uncomfortable experience of manspreading and being forced to close into oneself for fear of unwanted touching. Under the guise of handing women power, the airline is essentially normalising the behaviour of men and saying that if women want to escape this, they have an option to do so. Safety is your right, of course, but only as long as you can shell out the money! The fact of having to pay for a seat with the implicit idea that we can now buy safety shifts the burden of responsibility on women — yet again individualising what is, in essence, a systemic issue.

Unless the misbehaviour and entitlement of men on flights, and public spaces in general, is addressed, token “feminist” measures such as this one will only continue to place the blame on women. The inherent masculinisation of public spaces often makes them inhibiting for women. From public transport to roads, parks and even leisure spaces like restaurants and dhabas, most public spaces are geared for men, and hence, exclusionary. Something as simple as moving to the side in an elevator to make space for other people does not naturally occur to men. The infrastructure is intentionally invasive and imposing where women are meant to feel uncomfortable.

The idea of neoliberal feminism does not take into account these societal barriers that women face in accessing public spaces. IndiGo’s policy has further advanced the narrative of “men will be men” and hence, women must adjust. In this case, women must adjust by choosing to be cloistered with other women to feel safe in a closed environment. So that next time, in case of any untoward incident, the response is, “Oh! But she should have chosen to sit next to a woman.”

Pakistan witnessed 59 terror attacks in August,Cdata,2024-09-03 12:11:28+05:30,"In continued increase in terror attacks, a total of 59 terrorist attacks occurred across Pakistan in August 2024 killing 84 people compared to 38 such attacks in the previous month, a media report said on Tuesday.

The August attacks take the total number of attacks in 2024 to 325, according to the digital database of security incidents managed by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), an Islamabad-based think-tank.

These incidents include 29 attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 28 in Balochistan and two in Punjab, the PIPS data said, adding, as many as 84 people were killed and 166 others were injured, newspaper The Dawn said.

Also, since 2006, there have been 17,846 terrorist incidents in which 24,373 people have been killed and 48,085 others injured, according to the PIPS database.

Balochistan experienced 28 terrorist incidents during August 2024, which resulted in 57 deaths and injuries to another 84 people. Most of these terrorism-related casualties resulted from the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) orchestrated simultaneous attacks on August 26 in over seven districts of the province targeting security forces, non-Baloch people, mainly Punjabis, and national infrastructure.

August 26 was the death anniversary of Baloch chieftain Nawab Akbar Bugti when the group launched coordinated attacks across Balochistan.

In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 29 terrorist attacks claimed 25 lives and wounded 80 others. The banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam, Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) and a few local Taliban groups reportedly carried out these attacks, the report said.

Two attacks from Punjab injured two civilians and killed two of the attackers.

Meanwhile, security forces and the counterterrorism departments (CTDs) of the police conducted 12 anti-militant operations in the country in August compared to 11 in the previous month.

In these operations, 88 militants were killed and 15 army soldiers and three policemen martyred. Eight out of the 12 reported operations took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, while four others took place in Balochistan.

Drawing attention to how 26 out of the total 28 attacks recorded in Balochistan were carried out by the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the PIPS said in its monthly security report that the armed group has escalated its destructive activities, executing high-impact attacks and using female suicide bombers.

The report underlines that the involvement of numerous militants and the use of sophisticated weaponry including vehicle-borne explosives, indicates BLA’s growing capabilities.

The group has adopted new tactics, such as targeting Punjabis on highways by checking identity cards — a development that may further strain relations between the province and the central government, which seems to be one of the banned entity’s objectives.

The PIPS also said that positioning itself as a defender of Balochs’ interests, the BLA exploits grievances like enforced disappearances and resource exploitation and as the Baloch people lose faith in the political process, the group may gain more support.

“To counter this, the government must create political and social spaces for the Baloch people,” the report recommended.

Additionally, there is an urgent need to investigate the BLA’s sources of training, weapons and funding. Pakistan should engage constructively with Afghanistan and Iran to develop a joint counterterrorism and border security strategy, the report advised."

"After changes at helm, bureaucratic rejig expected soon in Delhi govt departments",Jatin Anand,2024-09-03 11:58:06+05:30,"Several senior officials posted across various Delhi government departments are likely to be reshuffled as part of a larger bureaucratic overhaul expected to be affected by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) over the coming days, according to sources aware of the developments.

Between 40 to 60 IAS, IPS, DANICS (Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu Civil Service) and DANIPS (Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands Police Service) officials are likely to be part of the exercise which, among other factors, has been necessitated by existing or upcoming vacancies on posts ranging from Chief Secretary to Director General among others in several AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory), or Central, cadre territories, sources said.

AGMUT cadre officials — posted in ministries and policing divisions under the central government in the Capital as well as the Delhi government, belonging to batches between 1990 and 1996 — are expected to be part of the reshuffle following a change at the helm both at the MHA and the Delhi administration in August.

After 1989-batch Sikkim cadre IAS officer Govind Mohan was last appointed recently as the Union Home Secretary, his batchmate and AGMUT cadre officer, Dharmendra, took over as Delhi’s Chief Secretary, the head of the city’s civil administration, within days.

“There are several senior IAS officials, either currently in the Government of India or in Delhi government departments, who have been posted in the Capital for more than three years; they will be part of the overhaul,” a senior government official said.

“Among the significant appointments which are now expected are on the posts of the Chief Secretaries of Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Goa, and Andaman; on the other hand, the crucial post of Principal Secretary (Home) in the Delhi government and Chairperson, New Delhi Municipal Council is also expected to be impacted,” the official added.

Sources said 1995-batch AGMUT cadre IAS officer Keshav Chandra, serving as the Chief Secretary of Andaman since 2022, was being considered a frontrunner for the post of New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) chairperson while 1995-batch officer Sajjan Singh Yadav, an additional secretary in the Union Finance Ministry, was said to be in the running to replace Dharmendra in Arunachal Pradesh.

The MHA, according to sources, was also looking for a replacement for 1988-batch IAS officer Renu Sharma, who has been serving as the Chief Secretary of Mizoram since November 2021, and is due to retire next month; and 1991-batch AGMUT cadre officer Puneet Kumar Goel who has been serving as the Goa Chief Secretary since February 2022."
Celebrate but sans noise – doctors appeal before festive season,Anuradha Mascarenhas,2024-09-03 11:51:17+05:30,"As the city prepares for Ganeshotsav, top ENT consultants have appealed to citizens and authorities to ensure noise levels do not exceed permissible limits.

An order issued by the National Green Tribunal (western zone) on August 30 also noted that permissible noise levels prescribed under Noise Rules, 2000, were routinely violated during the Ganesh festival and directed the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to conduct real-time noise monitoring at multiple locations and limit the capacity of loudspeakers at mandals.

On the pressing issue of noise pollution during the Ganesh festival, Pune-based audiologist Dr Kalyani Mandke sought directions to implement effective noise control measures, particularly concerning the use of loudspeakers and public address systems.

“The NGT directives are good ones. The tribunal directions are aimed at ensuring compliance with the Noise Pollution Rules and protecting the fundamental rights of citizens to a peaceful environment,” Dr Mandke said while quoting the order. “I do not expect changes overnight but these directives are important for sensitization of the community,” Dr Mandke told The Indian Express.

While the MPCB has been directed to conduct real-time noise monitoring at multiple locations near each Ganesh pandal and during Visarjan processions, the tribunal also said the total capacity of loudspeakers should be limited to a maximum of 100 watts, with specific conditions based on the location of the Ganesh mandals.

In cases of violation, the police were authorized to seize loudspeakers and sound systems and the tribunal has mandated the state government to conduct public awareness programs regarding the adverse effects of noise pollution.The order also stated that there should be a robust grievance mechanism for residents to report on cases of noise violations.

The World Health Organization defines noise above 65 decibels (dB) as noise pollution and above 75 dB as harmful noise. Noise about 120 dB is painful. Dr Seemab Shaikh, noted senior ENT consultant, strongly supported Dr Mandke’s petition and said that over the years, noise levels have exceeded prescribed limits laid down by WHO. “The hazards of high intensity noise exposure have been well documented and we need effective regulations to be implemented,” said Dr Shaikh.

“The NGT decision is very significant with all scientific facts. Concerned authorities need to work on effective implementation on ground at the micro level,” said Dr Mahesh Shindikar, head, Department of Applied Sciences and Humanities, COEP Technological University, Pune, who has led different teams of students for more than two decades in monitoring sound levels at various locations along Laxmi Road on the last day of the Ganesh festival.

Dr Robert Lobo, president of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India, Pune branch, said they have issued a friendly advisory to mandals and any society/individuals using loudspeakers to refrain from exceeding 85 dB noise levels. “Over the years, post festival, we have seen a rise in case of partial noise-induced deafness,” said Dr Lobo.

While ushering in the festive spirt and celebrating Ganesh festival, Pune district collector Dr Suhas Diwase has appealed mandals and cooperative housing societies to exercise self-restraint and abide by the noise control rules. “There are more than 3,000 mandals and we are talking to them. This is a social issue that has to be sensitively handled. We have told the agencies like police, civic and pollution control bodies to effectively implement noise pollution rules and as directed by the NGT order,” said Dr Diwase."

11 killed after bus crashes into group of students and parents in eastern China,Unknown,2024-09-03 11:37:22+05:30,"As many as 11 people were killed and 13 injured after a bus in China’s Shandong province crashed into a group of students and their parents on Tuesday, the Xinhua news agency reported.

The report states that the students and parents were waiting at the gate of a middle school in Tai’an city, shortly after 7 am, when the accident took place.

Six parents and five students were killed, the Dongping county police department said in a posting on social media. One of the injured is in serious condition while the others are stable, the department said.

While the cause of the accident is not clear, the bus driver has been taken into custody and an investigation is underway, the police said.

The bus was specially customised for transporting students. Many schools across China give out bus contracts to private companies or individuals. Over the years, issues such as overloaded school buses and poorly designed buildings have persisted.

In 2017, a dozen people, including 11 kindergarten pupils, were killed when a school bus crashed and burst into flames in a tunnel in the eastern Chinese city of Weihai, also in Shandong province.

It remains unclear whether the accident was caused by unsafe driving or if there were other factors involved.

In addition to transportation concerns, the country has faced a troubling number of attacks on schoolchildren in recent years, often involving knives or homemade explosives.

The perpetrators of these attacks are typically individuals with personal grievances or broader societal frustrations.

ED arrests 4 in Bengaluru for cheating people of Rs 25 crore in cyber investment scams,Cdata,2024-09-03 11:32:52+05:30,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) said on Monday that it has arrested four Bengaluru residents in a case related to cyber investment scams, adding that the accused siphoned about Rs 25 crore from people after they were lured to invest in the stock market through fake and fraudulent apps.

The central agency identified the arrested accused as Shashi Kumar M, 25, Sachina M, 26, Kiran SK, 25, and Charan Raj C, 26. All four were involved in the incorporation of companies and opening of bank accounts through which proceeds of crime generated from cyber scams were laundered, the ED said.

A special court in Bengaluru has remanded the accused to ED custody for a week each.

According to the ED, the agency conducted 13 searches at various premises under Section 17 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, which led to the seizure of incriminating material, including mobile phones and other digital devices.

The ED said it took up the case based on First Information Reports (FIRs) registered at Faridabad, Noida and Bathinda. In the Faridabad case, a 57-year-old woman had been cheated of Rs 7.59 crore; in Noida, a businessman lost Rs 9.09 crore; and in Bathinda, a doctor lost Rs 5.93 crore, the agency said.

The modus operandi

The ED said that the first step of the scam involved luring the victims via various social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Telegram, by giving false promises of high returns on investments, allotment of IPOs through special quota etc.

Once the victims showed interest, the scamsters would add their numbers to fake WhatsApp or Telegram groups that also had ‘fake members’ who shared fabricated success stories. These WhatsApp groups would have names similar to well-known apps or financial institutions like ICICI Securities, GFSL Securities, SMG Global Securities, Blackrock Capital, JP Morgan etc to create an impression that these groups were genuine, the agency said.

Once the victims were convinced, the scamsters asked them to install fraudulent apps. To install the apps, the scamsters then shared links with the victims. The names of various stocks, futures, options, forex etc. shown in the apps were the same as well-known companies (e.g. Reliance, Tata Power) to create an impression that the apps were genuine, the ED said.

According to the ED, the scamsters then encouraged the victims to invest in various fake IPO stocks, fake stocks etc. and made them transfer their money to the bank accounts of shell companies created for the specific purpose of collection of cybercrime proceeds.

To further build trust, the victims would initially get good returns on their investments as shown in the dashboard of the app, which gave them confidence and encouraged them to invest more. However, these returns were fictitious and were just numbers shown on the fake apps, the ED said.

As the victims invested more funds, they eventually realised that they were unable to withdraw their funds. When the victims tried to withdraw their money, the scammer asked them to pay statutory taxes, brokerage fees, etc. Once the fraudsters extracted as much money as possible, they would cut off all communication and disappear, leaving the victim with no recourse, the ED said.

Illegal SIM cards, mule bank accounts

According to the ED, the fraudsters contact various individuals within India via Telegram groups to acquire hundreds of SIM cards illegally. Once activated, these SIM cards are shipped abroad. They are either linked with the bank accounts of multiple shell companies or used to create and run WhatsApp accounts for defrauding victims, the agency said.

Scammers also incorporate hundreds of shell companies to acquire and siphon off proceeds of crime generated from these cyber scams, the ED said. They use the addresses of coworking spaces to provide a physical or virtual address for the incorporation of these shell companies. Further, it is revealed that during the filing of Form INC-20A (required to be filed for commencement of business by a company), fraudsters submit forged bank statements as proof of share subscription by shareholders, the agency said.

The ED’s investigation has further revealed that the scammers operate through a network of mule bank accounts rented through channels such as Telegram. The proceeds of crime are finally converted into cryptocurrency and siphoned off abroad to avoid detection and recovery, the agency added.

The funds are moved from the victim’s account through several intermediary accounts, including mule accounts taken on rent, and the numerous transactions between accounts create a convoluted web that conceals the source of the funds, the ED said. Small transaction amounts of less than Rs 5 lakh are used to avoid triggering alerts for suspicious activity and the illicit funds are routed through these shell companies, the agency added.

“A key finding of the investigation is that the proceeds of these fraudulent activities were mostly converted into cryptocurrency. This conversion was a deliberate strategy employed by the accused to further obscure the origins of the illicit funds and to facilitate their transfer out of India. By converting the proceeds into cryptocurrency and transferring them abroad, the perpetrators aimed to avoid detection, tracing, and recovery by law enforcement agencies,” the ED said."

"8 medals in one day at Paris 2024: From Nitesh to Sumit, how India’s most successful day ever at the Paralympics panned out",Vinayakk Mohanarangan,2024-09-03 11:21:25+05:30,"Before Tokyo Paralympics, the most medals India had won at a single edition was four, which had happened twice. First, at the 1984 edition, then once more four in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. Then came the surge in Tokyo three years back. On August 30 in Tokyo alone, India won five medals, back then a record. One of those five was a gold medal for Sumit Antil in men’s javelin. Fast forward three years, on the day Sumit defended his gold medal in Paris, India won a total of eight medals as September 2, 2024 became the country’s single most successful day in the history of Paralympics.

Here’s how the historic day panned out:

Silver – Yogesh Kathuniya (Athletics)

Yogesh kickstarted things in Men’s Discus Throw – F56 finishing second to retain his medal from three years back and entering the club of multiple medallists at the Paralympics from India. But, much like Nishad Kumar the previous night in high jump, Nishad he wasn’t a happy man. Despite a Season Best throw, Yogesh felt he had more left in him and a chance to push Brazil’s Claudiney Batista for a shot at gold.

Gold – Nitesh Kumar (Badminton)

Before Monday, Nitesh had not defeated Daniel Bethell in their nine past meetings. Despite being the top seed, Nitesh came in as an underdog but he found a way to get bast the Brit in the biggest match of his life. Nitesh beat Bethell 21-14 18-21 23-21 in an 80-minute thriller to win India’s second gold medal of the Paris Games. The win ensured the gold medal in Men’s Singles SL3 remained with India, despite the shock suspension of Tokyo champion Pramod Bhagat.

In Tokyo, all four of India’s Para Badminton medals were won by male shuttlers. But by reaching the final of Women’s Singles SU5, 22-year-old Thulasimathi had already ensured that won’t be the case in Paris. Her opponent in the final was Yang Qiu Xia, the reigning Paralympic and World Champion, and despite pushing her in some parts of the match, the Indian lost in straight games. It was however a historic silver.

A few minutes before Thulasimathi’s silver, 19-year-old Manisha ensured India will have two shuttlers on the podium in Women’s Singles SU5 as she dominated her Danish opponent in straight games to clinch bronze. Manisha had lost against Thulasimathi in the semifinal.

Silver: Suhas Yathiraj (Badminton)

Suhas had recently taken over from Lucas Mazur as the World No 1 in Men’s Singles SL4. He had faced Mazur in the final at the Tokyo games, and it was an epic three-game battle. But on Monday, he couldn’t quite find a tame the beast that is Mazur, who was backed by a sensational home crowd. At times it felt, he was playing two players on the other side. But still, at 41, the IAS officer retained his silver from Tokyo. Suhas is the only Indian shuttler to win two Paralympics medals now.

Bronze: Rakesh Kumar | Sheetal Devi (Archery)

There were 22 years separating them in terms of age, but seated a few centimeters away from each other, Rakesh and Sheetal took us on a proper rollercoaster to clinch bronze medal in Mixed Team Compound Open. They were expected to be contenders, given their billing as top seeds but it was a semifinal heartbreak by the smallest of margins against Iran. But they recovered quickly to beat Italy in another thriller to ensure India’s first archery medal in Paris, after a series of heartbreaks across the Olympics and Paralympics.

Was there really any doubt? Men’s Javelin Throw – F64 has become the event to pencil in on the calendar at any major para athletics event these days because of the rise and rise of Sumit Antil. After grabbing headlines in Tokyo, with a series of World Record-breaking throws, Sumit came to Paris with the pressure of defending the gold and competing in front of a crowd, the likes hadn’t seen before. But as ever, Sumit started his first throw in fine fashion to smash his own Paralympic Record… then went on to do it again, with his second throw for a stunning 70.59. The silver medal went for a distance of 67.03, and Sumit had three throws farther than that.

Bronze: Nithya Sre Sumathy Sivan (Badminton)

Late in the night, after what seemed to be an interminable delay, there was one more medal to come that pushed India’s count for the day to 8. On paper, Nithya Sre was the underdog for this one against Rina Marlina of Indonesia in the Women’s Singles SH6 bronze medal match. But Nithya Sre got off to a racing start, and despite brief signs of a fightback from the Indonesian (who didn’t appear to be at her best physical fitness), the Indian stormed through in straight games. It also ensured India won five para badminton medals in Paris, one more than in Tokyo, with three of them coming courtesy female shuttlers."
"After RSS ‘green signal’, will PM Modi ‘hijack another Congress guarantee’ and conduct caste census: Jairam Ramesh",Cdata,2024-09-03 11:20:48+05:30,"A day after the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) hinted at support for a caste census, one of the key demands by the Opposition, the Congress party posed some questions for the Sangh and the Bharatiya Janata Party.

Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, asked: “Now that the RSS has given the green signal, will the non-biological Prime Minister hijack another guarantee of the Congress and conduct a caste census?” He further questioned whether the Sangh has “veto power” on the matter. ”

On Monday, RSS publicity in-charge Sunil Ambekar, addressing a press conference indicated its support for the caste-based census, adding that it should not be used for “political or electoral purposes”. Calling the RSS’ stance as “didactic or preachy”, Ramesh asked: “What does the RSS mean when it says caste census should not be misused for election campaigning? Is it to be a judge or an umpire?”

This comes as the BJP has been facing demands for a caste census from not just the Opposition – particularly Congress leader Rahul Gandhi – but also its own NDA allies including the JD(U) and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas).

During the 2024 Lok Sabha polls campaigning, Rahul Gandhi had said conducting a caste census and providing a legal guarantee on the Minimum Support Price for crops would be the first two decisions or “guarantees” of the new Congress government after elections.

Ramesh questioned “who the RSS is” to give permission for a caste census. “Does RSS have veto power on caste census?” he added.

The Congress leader also flagged the RSS’ “mysterious silence” on the need for a constitutional amendment to enable reservations for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to exceed the 50 per cent cap.

The RSS on Monday also spoke about “issues” and “lack of coordination” between the BJP and the Sangh. But brushed them aside as a “family matter” that would be resolved through discussions."

The Karnataka Department of Stamps and Registration on Monday dismissed a senior sub-registrar in Bengaluru who was recently convicted of taking a bribe and sentenced to jail.

On Monday, the department dismissed him from the service. The disciplinary authority of the Department of Stamps and Registration issued the order dismissing Bhaskar.

Bhaskar, a sub-registrar at Chikkajala in the Bengaluru Urban District, was accused by one H M Jagadeesh of seeking a bribe. Following a complaint, the Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) caught him red-handed while receiving a bribe of Rs 15,000 to register a sale deed and arrested him.

Girish PR, who worked as a deed writer, was also arrested, but the court acquitted him. Judge K M Radhakrishna, in the sentence order, said, “I may not be wrong to say that public servants like the accused are doing business in the name of official function. The uninterrupted corrupt activities through the middlemen and agents have created a poisonous atmosphere in and around where the public is fighting and searching for pure air to breathe as silent spectators.”

Karnataka extends automated building approval programme to all wards of Bengaluru city,Cdata,2024-09-03 11:08:56+05:30,"The Karnataka Government on Monday extended its automated building approval programme to all wards of Bengaluru city in order to provide temporary building plan approvals online.

Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar, who is also the Bengaluru Development Minister, announced the expansion of ‘Nambike Nakshe’ (Trusted Plan) across all eight zones of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).

The programme will allow property owners to get a building plan approved through an architect or recognised engineer and apply online for plan sanction, he said.

The system will help avoid harassment faced by property owners while seeking sanction for new buildings or alterations to existing buildings, he said. Plan approvals will be issued online for sites measuring a maximum of 50×80 square ft. Following the approval of the plans, inspections will be carried out to ensure that the construction was as per the plan, Shivakumar said.

‘Nambike Nakshe’ is being extended across BBMP, following a successful pilot study carried out at RR Nagar and Dasarahalli zones from March.

Under the programme, registered engineers or architects conduct mandatory site inspections and verify documents during the initial plan approval stage. After this, property owners can upload site documents on the BBMP website. The software will assess whether the plan adheres to zonal regulations, apart from issuing provisional building licence.

On online criticism over potholes in the city, Shivakumar said that 2,795 potholes were identified in Bengaluru city limits as per current estimates. “I have told them that it should be filled in 15-days,” Shivakumar said.

19-yr-old shot dead by cow vigilantes in Faridabad; 5 held,Cdata,2024-09-03 10:50:51+05:30,"A 19-year-old in Haryana’s Faridabad was allegedly shot dead last month by a group of cow vigilantes who chased him thinking he was a cattle smuggler, the police said. Five men were arrested in the case later and sent to judicial custody.

The police identified the victim as Aryan Mishra, a Class 12 student at an open school in Faridabad, and said the incident took place near Palwal on August 23 after Mishra stepped out of his home at night to accompany his five friends in an SUV.

According to the police, the main accused, Anil Kaushik, runs an outfit called Live for Nation that advocates cow protection. On August 23, Kaushik and the other accused, Varun, Saurabh, Krishan and Adesh, allegedly received a tip-off that cow smugglers were in the area in a Renault Duster.

The accused gave chase to the vehicle Mishra and his friends were in and fired shots. Two bullets hit Mishra, according to his father Siya Nand Mishra’s complaint to the police. The initial complaint did not mention cow vigilantes as the family thought the incident was a fallout of some enmity against one of Mishra’s friends.

A First Information Report (FIR) was registered under several sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, invoking charges of murder and rioting, among others, and sections of the Arms Act. The police said their probe led them to CCTV footage that revealed the involvement of the cow vigilantes.

In his complaint, Mishra’s father said that his son went out with his friends Harshit Gulati, Sujata Gulati, Shanky, Sagar Gulati, and Kirti Sharma in Harshit’s Duster, without his family’s knowledge. “At 3.30 am, Harshit’s father came to our house and said there was an emergency, and we needed to go to Palwal urgently. My son (Ajay) left with him on a Scooty towards Palwal. About 10 minutes later, Ajay returned and informed me that I should also go. Both of us reached B K Hospital where Harshit’s father told us to proceed to SSB Hospital as Aryan was being brought there. When I asked him what had happened to Aryan, he said Aryan had been shot…Two bullets hit my son Aryan…,” he said in his complaint."

“Priyanka was somewhere in New York, studying her MBA at that time, and they (relatives) set everything up. My mother saw this, and she has seen enough of me saying ‘please don’t talk about it’ in the past. She had tried this in the past… She is looking at this photo, and I come home and see the picture and say ‘she is quite pretty’. Next thing I know is that she is telling me ‘you have to meet her’,” Vivek told Humans of Bombay.

In an interview with Curly Tales, he shared more details and said, “I didn’t want to get married, I was partying away. I was like no serious relationships. Its too much stress, too much complications. I had my fatherly emotion satisfied with my nieces and nephews. So, I was like, why to get married. My mom said, ‘meet this one girl, meet her and if you don’t like her, you say no, after that I will never tell you to meet anybody else but meet this one.'”

Vivek flew to Italy to see Priyanka, where she was holidaying with her family. “I planned to meet her in the afternoon. I thought, I will meet her as a formality, I will take the flight and head back home. One thing led to another, I realised I missed my flight. And then I ended up staying two-three days extra because I just didn’t want to leave. I was flat in love with her like the first 2 hours. It was like love at first sight”, he told Curly Tales.

Vivek Oberoi said it was not based on just the physicality. Recalling seeing her for the first time, Vivek told Humans of Bombay, “I was in a cafe, and I saw this girl walking in towards me. The first thing I noticed was that she was wearing flat chappals, simple linen pants, simple top, her hair tied up loosely with that stick and no make up. I was like ‘Waah confidence ki daad deni padegi’. She is not dressed up, she just came and sat in front of me and said, ‘Hi, sorry I am 10 minutes late’.”

Priyanka’s practical question won Vivek’s heart. “She blew my mind. She told me, ‘tell me about yourself’, I said, ‘I am an actor’. She said, ‘That’s just what you do. Tell me who you are.’ I was like ‘Oh my god, this just got real’ and it made me pause and think because that’s something not many times in life somebody will ask you. You are not used to the question, so you are not used to thinking of the answer. Otherwise we always have this prerecorded or rehearsed answers. I thought ‘Who am I? What do I want in life? Even after 14 years of marriage, I am still thinking about it”, Vivek told Curly Tales.

After his first meeting, Vivek pulled a Bollywood card to impress Priyanka and rented a convertible and reached where Priyanka was staying. “She was completely shocked to see me, and I said let’s go for a drive, and we took off and it was a day of just conversation and I don’t know what happened. At the end of the day, I dropped her home and I told her ‘Look, you are a lady, it’s your privilege to decide yes or no but if I am ever in my life going to get married its going to be with you. If I don’t marry you, I won’t get married at all. Rest is up to you. You take your time and decide’. And then I made my exit and that was it.”

Vivek and Priyanka married on October 29, 2010. The couple had a traditional South Indian wedding in Bengaluru in the presence of their close friends and family. The couple share two kids–Ameyaa Nirvana and Vivaan Veer. Priyanka Alva is the daughter of Karnataka politician Jeevaraj Alva and Nandani Alva."
"Separatist leaders enter poll fray, J&K parties welcome ‘move towards democracy’",Bashaarat Masood,2024-09-03 10:45:20+05:30,"A FORMER Hurriyat leader, the son of a Hurriyat executive member, a Jamaat-e-Islami leader and the brother of a jailed separatist leader. With the banned Jamaat-e-Islami coming forward to participate in elections in Jammu and Kashmir after a gap of nearly 40 years, putting up candidates as Independents, a range of other leaders are making a switch from the separatist side to the mainstream.

For J&K-based parties which chose to remain mainstream at the height of the separatist movement, this change is a “vindication” of their stand on Kashmir. The BJP too has welcomed the move, saying: “They are moving towards democracy.”

Among the biggest separatist names in the race is Syed Saleem Geelani, who joined the PDP Sunday. A resident of Srinagar, Geelani once headed the Jammu and Kashmir National People’s Party (NPP), which was a constituent of the Hurriyat Conference’s moderate faction led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq.

Advertisement

As part of the Hurriyat, Geelani was nominated by Mirwaiz in 2005 as an interlocutor to engage with Kashmiri Pandits for their return to the Valley.

In 2015, Geelani and a few other leaders revolted against Mirwaiz, accusing him of “violating the Hurriyat’s 1993 constitution by engaging in secret talks with New Delhi”.

After that, Geelani largely kept to the background, even as he formed his own party.

Addressing the media as he joined the PDP in the presence of Mufti Sunday, Geelani said he was “proud” of his association with the Hurriyat and described the PDP as a natural fit. “The PDP is the only (mainstream political) party that has talked about all aspects of Jammu and Kashmir – about the Kashmir issue, human rights, the concerns of the people and basic amenities.”

He was not looking to contest elections, Geelani said. “It is to raise the issues of the people and to work for them.”

Javid Hubbi, the son of former Hurriyat leader Ghulam Mohammad Hubbi, is the candidate of Engineer Rashid’s Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) from the Charar-e-Sharief Assembly segment.

In the recent Lok Sabha polls, Rashid, who is in jail since before the August 5, 2019, abrogation of Article 370, had pulled off the biggest upset when he had won from Baramulla defeating stalwarts Omar and People’s Conference leader Sajad Lone. While Rashid had contested as an Independent, now there is big demand for the AIP ticket in the Assembly polls.

Javid’s father Ghulam Hubbi, a doctor by profession, left a government job in 1983 to join the Abdul Gani Lone-led People’s Conference (now headed by Sajad). Ghulam unsuccessfully contested the 1983 and 1987 Assembly elections. After the alleged rigging of the 1987 elections, Ghulam joined other leaders in staying away from the electoral process.

In 2002, when Sajad Lone was accused of fielding proxy candidates in the Assembly elections, Ghulam Hubbi expelled him along with his brother Bilal and executive member Ghulam Mohidin Sofi, who had filed his nomination for the polls, from the People’s Conference.

Javid, a lawyer, has now followed in his father’s footsteps by taking the political plunge on the AIP ticket, with the Senior Hubbi calling it a day.

The Charar-e-Sharief constituency was won in 2014 by the PDP’s Ghulam Nabi Lone Hanjura, defeating senior NC leader and former finance minister Abdul Rahim Rather by over 5,000 votes. Both Hanjura and Rather are in the race again.

Another big name fielded by the PDP from the separatist camp is Aga Muntazir Mehdi. A prominent Shia cleric and the son of Hurriyat executive member Aga Syed Hassan, Mehdi is contesting from Budgam, which was in the past represented by his cousin and NC leader Aga Ruhullah.

Mehdi plays a significant role in the Anjuaman-E-Sharie Shian, an influential Shia party that is also a constituent of the Mirwaiz-led Hurriyat faction and known for its social work. Unlike the Ruhullah side of the family that has been in mainstream politics, Mehdi’s family has been associated with the separatist movement.

Mehdi says his “resistance background” led him to the PDP. “The PDP has said that what happened on August 5, 2019, is a problem but the real problem is beyond that, and it is the Kashmir issue itself. Other parties talk about dialogue without addressing the real issue,” he says.

Also in the fray is Altaf Ahmad Bhat, a social worker from South Kashmir’s Pulwama and the brother of jailed leader Bashir Ahmad Bhat, popularly known as Peer Saifullah. Bashir Ahmad was a close aide of the late Hurriyat patriarch Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who led the hardline faction of the conglomerate, and has been lodged in Tihar Jail in an alleged terror funding case for seven years.

Altaf Bhat is the candidate of the AIP from the Rajpora Assembly constituency, where he is up against the PDP’s Syed Bashir Ahmad and the NC’s Ghulam Mohidin Wani.

The Rajpora constituency was won in 2014 by senior PDP leader Haseeb Drabu. He had defeated the NC’s Ghulam Mohidin Mir by close to 5,000 votes.

Among the Jamaat-e-Islami backed Independent candidates is Kaleemullah, the son of the outfit’s former general secretary Ghulam Qadir Lone. An engineer from the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Srinagar, who recently finished his doctorate, Kaleemullah is contesting from Langate in North Kashmir’s Kupwara.

The seat was represented in 2008 and 2014 by Engineer Rashid. In 2014, Rashid had defeated the PDP’s Ghulam Nabi Ganai by around 2,500 votes.

The Jamaat-e-Islami, whose hope that the Centre would revoke the ban on it was dashed, has fielded four candidates as Independents for the first phase of the J&K polls, to be held on September 18, and is planning to field 8-10 candidates more, especially for the third phase. Ghulam Qadir is one of the members of the Jamaat panel that took the call on contesting elections.

Munir Khan, the brother of jailed Hurriyat leader Nayeem Ahmad Khan, is also planning to contest, after failing to make a mark in the Lok Sabha polls. He was a candidate from the Baramulla seat in the recent Lok Sabha elections and lost his security deposit. The outfit founded by Munir’s father, Jammu and Kashmir Nationalist People’s Front, is planning to field many candidates.

The Jammu and Kashmir National People’s Front was a constituent of the Hurriyat faction led by Geelani. Nayeem has been in prison since 2017.

Speaking to reporters in Kangan, Ganderbal, Monday, National Conference (NC) vice-president and former chief minister Omar Abdullah said: “It (separatists contesting polls) shows that there has been an ideological shift. We have been maintaining that whatever is to be achieved can be achieved through democratic ways… If they (the separatist leaders) have developed faith in democracy, it is our achievement… Irrespective of which political party they join.”

Peoples Democratic Party chief and ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti welcomed the return of separatists to the mainstream, saying democracy is “a battle of ideas”.

Advertisement

BJP media in-charge Sajid Yousuf said: “Irrespective of which political party they join or form, it is a good move… They are accepting democracy now… the same organisations which used to call for a boycott or those who were against democracy.”

“The credit for this should go to the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he told The Indian Express. “They have given them (the separatist leaders) a chance to contest elections.”"

TasteAtlas categorises Chicken Tikka Masala as a British dish and netizens are not happy: ‘Look at the name itself’,Cdata,2024-09-03 10:30:16+05:30,"Chicken tikka masala is a dish that has become synonymous with Indian cuisine for many people around the globe. Known for its vibrant, spiced sauce and succulent pieces of grilled chicken, it has found a special place on menus from London to New York.

TasteAtlas, a popular food review site, released its list of 50 best chicken dishes from across the world, where it categorised chicken tikka masala as a British dish, igniting a debate among netizens who weren’t very happy with this.

One user wrote, “How come chicken tikka masala became British? Look at the name itself!! Does it sound British to you?”

“Chicken Tikka Masala is an Indian dish not British @tasteatlas,” another user pointed out.

A curious person commented, “Chicken tikka masala originated from the UK?”

Many argue that the dish’s roots may not be as firmly planted in India as commonly believed, citing its evolution in British curry houses as a key factor in its global identity.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by TasteAtlas (@tasteatlas)

But, what is the truth behind it?

Kanikka Malhotra, consultant dietician and certified diabetes educator, tells indianexpress.com, “India is where chicken tikka masala first appeared. Traditional Indian cuisine is where the dish’s two main ingredients, creamy tomato sauce and chicken tikka, first appeared. Indians love chicken tikka, a marinated boneless chicken kebab that’s frequently cooked in a tandoor oven. It’s possible that the creamy tomato sauce was modified from comparable Indian sauces that were used in other curries.”

She adds, “Although chicken tikka masala originated in India, the United Kingdom is where the dish first became widely known worldwide. Indian and Bangladeshi communities migrated to the UK and other Western countries, bringing their culinary traditions with them.” It’s thought that the meal was changed to accommodate British palates, maybe by increasing the amount of cream and reducing the amount of spice.

Influence of British curry houses on the evolution of chicken tikka masala

Chicken tikka masala has evolved significantly thanks in large part to British curry establishments, says Malhotra. “In order to cater to local tastes, British curry establishments modified the dish, frequently using ingredients and cooking methods that were more recognisable to British diners. “

She continues, “The process of adaptation resulted in mild modifications to the flavour profile and cooking method of chicken tikka masala. Indian food still has a strong hold on chicken tikka masala, even in the wake of British curry establishments. Even while the meal has been modified to suit Western tastes, its essential ingredients — chicken tikka and a rich tomato sauce — are distinctly Indian.”

Role of cultural adaptation in the classification of international dishes

Malhotra agrees that the categorisation of international cuisine heavily relies on cultural adaptation. “Food experiences a process of adaptation when it moves across borders and is impacted by regional flavours, ingredients, and cooking methods. This may result in notable alterations to the dish’s flavour profile, presentation, and cooking techniques.”

When categorising foods that have evolved across different regions, it is important to consider:

-The dish’s origin and core elements, such as key ingredients and cooking techniques, are essential to its classification. Even if the dish has undergone significant adaptations, its roots can still be traced back to its original culture.

-The cultural context in which the dish has evolved is also important. The influence of local tastes, ingredients, and traditions can help to shape its identity.

-The extent to which the dish has been adapted should be considered. If the changes are significant, it may be appropriate to classify it as a new, distinct dish. However, if the core elements remain intact, it can still be considered a variation of the original.

-How the dish is perceived and used by people in different cultures can also be a factor. If it is widely recognized and consumed as a traditional dish in a particular region, it can be classified as part of that culture’s cuisine."
"To crack down on illegal industrial units causing pollution, Delhi govt constitutes 12-member joint team",Cdata,2024-09-03 10:24:34+05:30,"To tackle pollution caused by illegal industrial units such as dyeing facilities, the Delhi government on Monday established a 12-member joint team to conduct a survey of all unauthorised units across the city.

The joint team includes members from several departments, such as the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Limited (BSES), Delhi Jal Board, Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), and industry departments.

“The team has been directed to conduct a survey of all such industrial units running illegally across the national capital, seal such units, cut their electricity and water connection on the spot so that they do not operate,” said a senior government official.

Officials also stated that the MCD, which is responsible for overseeing building plans and road infrastructure in residential areas, will also be tasked with surveying all unauthorised industrial units operating in residential areas.

“Several small illegal businesses are being operated across the city, especially in the outer parts such as Geeta Colony in North East Delhi, and Mundka, Nangloi, Alipur, and other areas in North West Delhi. These units operate in violation of all the rules and guidelines, and there have been major fire incidents in these parts of the city. Additionally, industrial waste is being released without treatment into the Yamuna river, leading to pollution. As a result, zonal officials of MCD are conducting surveys and immediately shutting down such units on the spot,” said officials.

Between May 1 and June 24, 2024, approximately 276 units operating in non-conforming areas were surveyed. Out of these, nine units were sealed or had their electricity disconnected. In the remaining cases, show-cause notices have been issued. Officials also mentioned that the MCD had been instructed to increase inspections and take significant action in residential areas in collaboration with other members of joint teams.

Meanwhile, the L-G office stated in a press note on Monday that four illegal dyeing units in Matiala, which pollute the Yamuna and illegally extract groundwater, had been sealed following the directions of L-G V K Saxena. Officials said they took action after a user on X posted about illegal dyeing units in Galibpur village in the Matiala Assembly constituency last month and tagged the L-G.

Officials said the L-G appealed to the residents to come forward and ensure participatory governance by serving as the state’s “eyes and ears.”"
Kharge family-run Siddhartha Vihar Trust under scanner again for land allocation to Pali Institute in Kalaburagi,Cdata,2024-09-03 10:20:55+05:30,"Less than a week after alleging irregularities in the allocation of a Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) site to a trust run by All India Congress Committee (AICC) president Mallikarjun Kharge’s family, BJP Rajya Sabha MP Lahar Singh Siroya contended that an institute run by the Siddhartha Vihar Trust was given 19 acres of government land free of cost.

“New documents reveal that 19 acres of government land was given FREE to the International Institute of Pali, Sanskrit and Comparative Philosophy in Gulbarga, run by the Siddhartha Vihara Trust managed by the Shri Mallikarjuna Kharge family,” Siroya said in a tweet.

Karnataka IT/BT minister Priyank Kharge, who is a member of the Trust, denied the charges.

The land in question was initially given to the institute on lease for 30 years by the then Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in March 2014. Three acres were added to the original grant, and in March 2017, the 19 acres of land were transferred “free of cost to the Kharge family-run Institute”, Siroya alleged, demanding a probe by an independent agency.

“Another pertinent question to ask in the context is, did the Shri Siddaramaiah government come under pressure from Kharge to grant parcels of land to their private trust or was the Congress government in Karnataka trying to please Shri Kharge?” Siroya said in a statement.

Priyank Kharge denied the charges, maintaining that the state government had given the land to the Pali Institute “on lease for 30 years”. “Land is only leased to Pali Institute and there is no grant of land to Pali Institute,” he said.

After the institute was announced in the 2012-13 Union Budget, the trust had “requested assistance from the Karnataka government for the development of this institute,” Priyank responded. “This request of the Siddhartha Vihar Trust was accepted by the then Karnataka government and support was announced for the institute in the state budget 2013-14 by Sri Jagadish Shettar, then Chief Minister of Karnataka,” he added.

The Pali Institute was established in 2014 as a public trust with deputy commissioner, Kalaburagi, representing the Karnataka government as the author of the trust. Detailing the courses offered by it, the minister claimed that eight batches of students each had graduated from its six-month certificate course and one-year diploma course.

The development came a week after allegations of nepotism in the grant of a KIADB site at Hi-Tech Defence and Aerospace Park to set up a research and development institute proposed by the Trust.

Earlier in the day, Governor Thawarchand Gehlot had sought an explanation from the state government over the allocation. This was based on a complaint filed by the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council Chalavadi Narayanaswamy."

"Union MoS Jitendra Singh: ‘BJP is fighting all Jammu seats and a big number in Kashmir. No thought of post poll-alliance, will get full majority’",Arun Sharma,2024-09-03 10:03:55+05:30,"With A lot at stake for the BJP in the first Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, one of the leaders who is playing a crucial role is Jitendra Singh, who won his third successive parliamentary election from the Udhampur-Doda seat in Jammu. A part of the Narendra Modi Cabinet since 2014, Singh holds many portfolios as a Union Minister of State, including in the PMO. In an interview with The Indian Express, Singh, whose brother Devender Singh Rana is another important leader in BJP ranks, says the party is on an “upward trend” in J&K, and asserts that despite recent incidents, militancy is in “its last phase”.

Excerpts:

Q) How is the BJP viewing the Assembly elections in J&K? How different are they from the last elections in 2014?

Ten years back, there was a lot of fear in the Valley. The ruling alliance (of the Congress and National Conference) found it convenient to have the elections under that fear psychosis… The turnout would be 8-10-15%. They (the alliance) would get their MLAs and MPs elected.

Advertisement

They also promoted dynasty rule. Now, it is different. You see the DDC (District Development Council) elections… It saw 70-80% polling. The Lok Sabha elections, the voting percentage was almost equal to the national average.

This time, we expect an open and free voter turnout in large numbers. People across J&K are waiting to find an outlet for their democratic and electoral aspirations. This is an achievement of the Modi government. Before, it was a taboo to carry the BJP’s flag in Kashmir. Now, BJP flags are spontaneously being unfurled all over the region. And the youth of J&K have realised that their future is more secure under PM Modi… This is an election full of democratic fervour and full of aspirations of the youth.

Q) Are there any difficulties you are facing as you go to the J&K electorate after five years of Central rule?

There are difficulties because we did not have local representatives. So there was a gap and the people realised it. Once you have a multi-tier system in place, many of the aspirations and grievances, right or wrong, get addressed, which was not possible. Mostly, the MPs were trying to play their role… which does not always do full justice… We did not have MLAs for so many years, the terms of corporations, municipal councils, panchayats expired… For the people to relate to the bureaucracy is not always easy…

Advertisement

That sometimes gives the people a feeling that they need to have someone whom they can talk to, whenever they want. So that is one gap people feel. But I do not think that goes wholly against the BJP because the circumstances were like that. For redressal of that gap too, people find the BJP as the best option.

Q) There have been protests by BJP cadre over distribution of tickets. Can these affect the party’s chances?

The BJP (in J&K) is now seen as a party with prospects. So, everyone wants to be a BJP candidate… But the BJP is a cadre-based party. Once the candidates are decided, they know that the decision is taken in a democratic manner and not at a dinner table.

Q) Is the BJP looking at a post-poll alliance?

The BJP is fielding candidates in all the seats in Jammu region. In Kashmir also, we will be contesting a substantial number of seats. However, there is no thought of any post poll-alliance. As of now, the BJP is confident of getting a full majority on its own.

Advertisement

Q) What will be the BJP’s agenda if it comes to power?

After the abrogation of Article 370, refugees and other sections of society started getting the rights they were deprived of. The biggest example is that of West Pakistan refugees… They were here for the past 70 years. Their counterparts in other parts of the country got their rights, and two from the same section of society – I K Gujral and Dr Manmohan Singh – went on to become PMs… But they were deprived because of the vested interest of the Congress and its allies because they thought that they were not part of their vote bank.

Secondly, most of the Central schemes were implemented in a twisted manner (in J&K), which was not fully in the interest of public welfare. The 73rd and 74th amendment relating to the Panchayat Act provides for direct transfer of Central funds to elected representatives of panchayats and local bodies. In J&K, Central allocations went to the Chief Minister, who then decided how much to distribute.

The last five years (since Article 370’s abrogation) were spent in making up for those lapses.

If we try to visualise J&K in the future… all of its unused and unexplored natural resources will be utilised. J&K has the capability of becoming an important component of India’s future growth story (under the BJP).

Q) How do you assess the situation in Jammu in light of the recent attacks by militants?

It is true that Pakistan-sponsored militants have shifted their focus from the Kashmir Valley to the Jammu region because of pressure. But now the (armed) forces have revised their strategy, which of course cannot be discussed publicly. But I am sure that it is going to bear results in the next few weeks. In totality, the militancy – as it was prevalent – is no longer there. Stone-pelting incidents are almost zero… The biggest testimony is the inflow of tourists.

Some killings do happen because the terrorists are on the run and they wish to make news every now and then. Otherwise, this is the last phase of militancy in J&K.

Q) Do you have any regrets about the BJP joining the coalition with the PDP after the 2014 Assembly elections?

In the history of independent India, this is the only occasion where a political party decided to walk out of a government without any compulsion. (The BJP left the alliance with the PDP in June 2018). There was no vote of confidence, or defections… We had the full majority in the House. Everything was in place. People also were not asking us to quit, but we walked out for ideological reasons. That is the difference between the BJP and the other parties.

We did not stick there for power. We went in to serve a purpose as envisaged by (Syama Prasad) Mookerjee when he set up the Jana Sangh (a precursor to the BJP). He was asked why he wanted to have a political outfit when there was already a sangathan (organisation) in place. He said because we can implement our agenda only when we are participants in power."

Supreme Court seeks reply from Telangana CM Revanth Reddy over remarks on K Kavitha’s bail: ‘some sort of restraint is expected’,Cdata,2024-09-03 10:00:03+05:30,"The Supreme Court on Monday yet again expressed displeasure over some remarks made allegedly by Telangana Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy regarding the bail granted to Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha in the Delhi excise policy case.

“It’s unfortunate that the courts and lawyers are being dragged into… and particularly when somebody is holding a high office, some sort of restraint is expected,” Justice B R Gavai presiding over a two-judge bench said while granting two weeks to Reddy to file a response to the application accusing him of making the alleged remarks.

The bench, also comprising Justice K V Viswanathan, was hearing a plea seeking the transfer of trial against Reddy in the 2015 cash-for-votes case from Telangana to Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh.

The petitioner BRS MLA Guntakandla Jagadish Reddy also filed an application accusing him of making certain statements regarding Kavitha’s bail. Documents filed with the application showed social media posts depicting the court order and lawyers who appeared for Kavitha. The posts also had comments like “one law for land grabbers, another for the government. What is this, My Lord”. The court also took exception to these.

Justice Viswanathan said, “We all come and go. God forbid, if his liberty is in jeopardy some time, this institution will protect it…”.

Senior Advocate Siddharth Luthra who appeared for Reddy said the statements were dated August 29 whereas he had tendered an unconditional apology on August 30. “This (statement) is prior in point of time,” said Luthra.

The bench, however, sought a reply and said it would hear it after two weeks.

On August 29, the bench presided by Justice Gavai had taken stern exception to Reddy’s comments, suggesting a “deal between BRS and BJP”, following the bail to Kavitha in the alleged Delhi excise policy scam. “We are not bothered about politicians, or if anybody criticises our orders or not. We do our duty as per our own conscience as per our oath,” Justice Gavai remarked then."
Shivaji Maharaj had looted Surat: Narayan Rane,Cdata,2024-09-03 09:55:16+05:30,"Senior BJP leader and former Union minister Narayan Rane on Monday said Maratha King Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had indeed looted Surat.

Addressing the media at BJP headquarters in Mumbai, Rane, responding to a question said, “I am not a historian. But from whatever I have read, heard, and known from historian Babasaheb Purandare, “Shivaji Maharaj ni Surat la loot keli” (Shivaji Maharaj had looted Surat).

Rane’s statement comes a day after Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday had attacked Congress for false propaganda against Shivaji saying, “Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj never looted Surat.”

Fadnavis went to the extent of saying, “Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had wrongly projected Shivaji Maharaj in his book Discovery of India to project the warrior king as someone who plundered Surat. However, these were factually wrong assumptions.”

“Post-Independence Congress deliberately taught Shivaji looted Surat. Whereas, the correct position is Shivaji plundered the treasury from the rightful people for ‘swarajya’ or attacked them for the larger welfare of the nation.

After the Chhatrapati Shivaji statue collapsed at Malvan in Sindhudurg district, the ruling and opposition sides are accusing each other of distorting the facts on the king.

It must be mentioned here that history books mention that Shivaji had attacked and looted Surat twice in 1664 and 1670 which was then an economically prosperous city and a major port of Mughals.

During the media interaction, Rane said, “The opposition was politicising the Shivaji statue collapse keeping elections in mind which was unfortunate. A senior leader of Sharad Pawar’s stature should have come out and appealed for peace. But it is evident that opposition is trying to use the incident to vitiate the atmosphere.”

Taking serious objection to Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Uddhav Thackeray asking CM Eknath Shinde to get out of the country, Rane said, “What right does he have to make such a remark? Is he the president of India or PM. Had I been the CM, I would have ensured stern action against Thackeray.”

Underplaying the skirmishes between Shiv Sena (UBT) and Rane followers in Malvan, after the statue collapse, Rane said, “The police should have ensured that political parties are allowed to visit the site one after another.” There was no violence or clashes, he asserted.

The Shiv Sena (UBT) has accused Rane supporters of triggering violence in the district.

Rane, replying to the query said, “As the CM of Maharashtra, during my tenure there were encounters of those who were anti-national criminals, who were on police list.”

Commenting on FIR against MLA Nitesh Rane for making communal remarks in Pune and Ahmednagar rallies, the Rane senior said, “I spoke to Nitesh. I explained to him not to drag the entire community. Instead, if there are any issues he should confine it to individuals.”"

Delhi HC stops T-Series from using ‘Aashiqui’ titles as filmmaker Mukesh Bhatt’s firm claims trademark right,Sohini Ghosh,2024-09-03 09:46:39+05:30,"The Delhi High Court on Monday restrained T-Series from using the titles ‘Tu Hi Aashiqui’ or ‘Tu Hi Aashiqui Hai’ for an upcoming film by ordering an interim injunction in favour of filmmaker Mukesh Bhatt’s film production company Vishesh Films, saying that it holds the trademark rights over ‘Aashiqui’ mark that has become a brand unto itself since the 1990 hit film that had a sequel in 2013.

Vishesh Films had registered trademarks for ‘Aashiqui’ in 2013 and ‘Aashiqui Ke Liye’ in 2014.

Bhatt’s company had dragged T-Series to court earlier this year after both parties had planned to make a third sequel, Aashiqui 3. But T-Series announced a deceptively similar-sounding film titled ‘Tu Hi Aashiqui’ or ‘Tu Hi Aashiqui Hai’ on its own.

Advertisement

Notably, Bhatt and T-Series co-produced the first two instalments of the Aashiqui franchise, with joint approval, joint credits, and joint consent on all aspects of release.

Taking their history of collaboration into account, Justice Sanjeev Narula held, “Thus, neither party can exploit any rights in the films by excluding the other, and the defendant (T-Series) cannot be permitted to make a sequel, remake, or adaptation of the Aashiqui franchise, or create any third-party rights in respect of the same, without the plaintiff’s (Vishesh Films) express consent.”

The court further said, “This includes control over scripts, pre-production, production, and participation in any underlying works of the first two ‘Aashiqui’ films — namely, their script, screenplay, plot, dialogues, characters, storyline, theme and more… The use of the term ‘Aashiqui’ would inevitably evoke a perceived connection to the Aashiqui franchise, especially given the powerful association established between the title ‘Aashiqui’ and the Aashiqui franchise, which both the parties created jointly.”

Prima facie, observing that ‘Aashiqui’ is not a generic trademark but rather “serves as a distinctive identifier of the Aashiqui franchise”, the court recorded that “the deceptive similarity” is further compounded as T-Series’s announcement of its film comprises the same director and lead actor associated with the T-Series-Bhatt’s joint Aashiqui 3 project plan.

In a turn of events, T-Series had also contended before the court that Bhatt’s company had not taken any action for the use of the word ‘Ashiqui’ in the movie title ‘Chandigarh Kare Ashiqui’ – a 2021 Hindi film – that was also produced by T-Series. T-Series had argued that this would amount to Bhatt’s company acquiescing rights. Justice Narula, however, held that it finds no basis to conclude the same and neither does such inaction diminish Bhatt’s rights over the trademark.

“The ‘Aashiqui’ title is not just an instance of isolated use, but rather, has become part of a recognised film series, with two successful instalments released in 1990 and 2013. It is crucial to protect titles of expressive works that become part of a series and have the potential of acquiring distinctiveness,” the court said.

“In this case, considering the fact that the parties have previously publicised the possibility of co-producing a third instalment to the Aashiqui franchise, there exists a strong public association of the ‘Aashiqui’mark with the continuing series of films…trademark law is particularly concerned with the initial likelihood of confusion, whereby the public might be misled into believing there is an association between the defendant’s (T-Series) film and the well-established Aashiqui franchise. This confusion, even if temporary, can cause significant harm by diluting the ‘Aashiqui’ brand and diminishing the distinctiveness of the Aashiqui franchise,” the court added.

The court further pointed out that Vishesh Films’ rights in the ‘Aashiqui’ trademark extend to protecting the title from such confusion, which is “especially likely” given the strong public association of the word ‘Aashiqui’ with the series. “In such circumstances, permitting the defendant (T-Series) to use a deceptively similar title, especially given the existing public anticipation of a third instalment of the Aashiqui franchise, would have the effect of infringing the plaintiff’s trademark rights by misleading consumers and diluting the brand identity of the Aashiqui franchise,” the court verdict reasoned."

"Explained: As RSS wraps up baithak in Kerala, all about Sangh’s four annual meetings",Shyamlal Yadav,2024-09-03 09:36:14+05:30,"Sunil Ambekar, the publicity in-charge of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, on Monday (September 2) hinted at the Sangh’s support for a caste census. He said that “it is a well-established practice” to gather data for “welfare activities, particularly those targeting such communities or castes which are lagging behind” but cautioned against this being used as a “political tool for elections”.

Ambekar spoke on the final day of the Sangh’s three-day Akhil Bharatiya Samanvay Baithak which was held in Palakkad, Kerala. The Samanvay Baithak is one of four annual meetings of the RSS.

Samanvay Baithak

Usually held in August-September, the purpose of this meeting is samanway (literally, “coordination”) between the Sangh and its frontal organisations, and to avoid any clashes between them. One of the most important parts of the meeting is the open session, in which delegates express their concerns on various issues.

Advertisement

The meeting in Palakkad was set to have in attendance 230 delegates from 32 organisations such as the Rashtra Sevika Samiti, Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, BJP, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, Vidya Bharati, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Sanskar Bharati, Seva Bharati, Sanskrit Bharati, Akhil Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad among others, in addition to members of the Sangh’s Kendra Karyakari Mandal (Central Executive Committee).

From the BJP, the meeting was attended by party president J P Nadda, general secretary (organisation) BL Santosh, and his deputy Shiv Prakash. Since the party came to power in 2014, this baithak has generated a lot of media interest.

For instance, the 2018 meeting, held in the village of Mantralayam in the Andhra-Karnataka border, saw then BJP chief Amit Shah cop criticism for the government’s failure to deliver on major Sangh Parivar promises such as the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution. One of the first major moves made by the BJP-led government after returning to power in next year’s elections was to revoke this section, which gave special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

This year saw the Samanvay Baithak be held in Kerala for the first time. Last year’s meeting was held in Pune, Maharashtra.

Pratinidhi Sabha

The Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS), usually held in the first fortnight of March, is the Sangh’s biggest annual gathering, where organisational issues are discussed, grand strategy is planned, the Sangh’s activities over the past year are reviewed, and resolutions on important issues are adopted.

For instance, in the 2022 ABPS, held in Karnavati in Gujarat, the RSS fixed a target of opening at least 1 lakh shakhas (grassroots units) across the country by 2025. Submissions made in this year’s ABPS held in Nagpur show that the RSS currently has a network of more than 73,000 shakhas nationwide.

The ABPS is also the forum where the Sangh’s annual training camps (Karyakarta Vikas Vargas and Sangh Shiksha Vargs) which are held in May-June are planned and discussed.

The Sangh’s apex policy-making forum sees the participation of more than 1,500 delegates, with representatives (or pratinidhis) from most districts of the country, as well as pracharaks working abroad, in attendance. The bulk of these delegates are the akhil bharatiya pratinidhis (all-India representatives) of active swayamsevaks. One prantiya pratinidhi (state representative) represents around 50 active swayamsevaks, and akhil bharatiya pratinidhi represents 20 prantiya pratinidhis.

Other delegates include members of the Sangh’s national executive, kshetra and prant (state) executives, members of the ABPS, all vibhag pracharaks, and certain office-bearers of various RSS-affiliated organisations. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad usually sends around 40 delegates, the most among the RSS affiliates, although the meeting’s composition is not set in stone.

The ABPS is held in venues across the country. Once every four years, the meeting is held in Nagpur, the birthplace of the RSS.

July baithak

The Prant Pracharak Baithak, more popularly known in RSS circles as the ‘July baithak’, is usually held over three days in mid-July. This meeting is purely meant to iron out organisational issues, and takes place just after the Sangh’s annual training camps, and just before its guru dakshina functions (annual events in which the Sangh raises funds for organisational expenses).

The July baithak sees those of the rank of prant pracharak and above in attendance. Pracharaks are individuals who work for the RSS full-time, without any remuneration. A total of around 150 delegates attend the meeting. The transfer of RSS functionaries, and major organisational shuffles are mostly announced in this meeting and during the Diwali meeting.

Advertisement

This year’s July baithak was held in Ranchi, Jharkhand. Last year, the meeting was held in Udhagamandalam (Ooty) in Tamil Nadu.

Diwali baithak

The Kendriya Karyakari Mandal (KKM) is usually held in October-November around the festival of Deepawali. It is attended by nearly 300 delegates, including top RSS leadership and representatives of its above-mentioned anushangik (frontal) organisations.

Most RSS resolutions on important issues are discussed and passed during the KKM and the ABPS. For instance, the 1950 KKM held in Nagpur saw the passage of seven resolutions on a number of issues.

Resolution 7 was particularly interesting. It said: “The Republic Day 26th January, 1950 be celebrated as a festival in all the Sangh branches throughout the country as a day heralding severance of all connection of the British crown with the Government of the country. Appropriate meetings behold under the auspices of the Sangh and the function should include hoisting and salutation of the state Flag, speeches befitting the occasion and ‘Vande-Mataram’ at the close”. At the time, this meeting was held in early January.

Rhea Chakraborty on feeling dehumanised in jail after Sushant Singh Rajput’s death: Tips to reintegrate into society after life-changing events,Cdata,2024-09-03 09:30:05+05:30,"After facing significant personal challenges or life-changing events, reintegrating into society can be a complex process.

Actor Rhea Chakraborty in conversation with Karishma Mehta for her podcast, reflected on her time in jail after boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput’s untimely death in 2020. She spoke about the profound impact the experience had on her sense of self and identity.

“Jail is actually a very different world because there’s no society in jail. There is a weird sense of equality. Everyone is a number, they are not a person. You are a UT number when you are in under trial prison…It’s a strange world, it’s a very evolved crowd. Because it’s just human emotion at its basic rawest. It’s survival. You have to survive each day, and each day feels like a year. It takes a long time for a day to finish because you’re literally doing nothing. There it is paused,” she said.

She continued, “My time in there was actually really difficult in the first two weeks to kind of adjust to this situation because no one ever believes that they are going to jail. Once you are in there, it takes a long time to understand that this has happened. There is a deep depression and darkness that I obviously experienced…You are really thinking negative thoughts now. I’ve always been a very bubbly, positive person, like delusionally optimistic.”

As individuals work to rebuild their lives, understanding the psychological and social aspects of reintegration becomes crucial.

Common psychological challenges individuals face

Sonal Khangarot, licensed rehabilitation counsellor and psychotherapist, The Answer Room, tells indianexpress.com, “Major personal setbacks or trauma calls for both interpersonal and intrapersonal concerns i.e., their relationship with self and their relationship with others, family, friends, professional relations, among others”

She continues, “The real struggle is how one views themselves, shattered sense of self especially after an event which strips of previous identity can lead to identity crisis where one finds it difficult to recognise themselves.”

Trauma often leads to PTSD when an individual gets flashbacks, heightened negative intrusive thoughts, nightmares about the life event and often experience difficulty in sleeping and eating.



“Depression is common, marked by persistent feelings of hopelessness, a low mood, and a diminished will to continue with life. Anxiety also frequently manifests, presenting as constant worry, restlessness, and fear that similar events might recur,” Khangarot informs.



There may be a prolonged state of being ‘stuck’ in the fight-or-flight response, which dysregulates the nervous system. Additionally, feelings of shame and guilt often emerge, as individuals may unconsciously blame themselves for what occurred, leading to self-sabotage and negative self-judgments.

How can individuals rebuild their self-esteem and sense of identity?

To rebuild self-esteem and identity, Khangarot says individuals can:

Advertisement

-Seek professional help to understand their experiences and learn strategies to navigate their challenges.

-Engage with a trusted support group or safety net — people who provide reliable emotional support.

-Adopt a ‘one day at a time’ approach by setting small, achievable daily goals, such as getting out of bed, talking to a friend, or eating regular meals.

-Participate in activities and hobbies that bring joy and meaning, like enrolling in a class or exploring new interests.

Advertisement

-Practice self-compassion and mindfulness techniques, such as gratitude journaling, belly breathing, or visualisation exercises, to foster inner calm and clarity.

Managing public scrutiny or stigma

Khangarot says, “As I mentioned earlier, major life events don’t just hamper our social image, but also how we view ourselves, which means that it goes down to shaking our core beliefs. Cognitive restructuring can help by reframing negative thoughts and moving from a reactive to a more adaptive mindset.”

Getting involved with individuals, organisations which support and work towards what one has experienced, can also help along with building a support system that understands you and provides you with a non judgmental safe space.

“Utilising platforms or agencies that allow individuals to share their stories and be heard can further empower them to reclaim their narrative and reduce the burden of stigma,” she mentions.

Daily briefing: SC puts an end to bulldozer justice?; UP’s ‘Operation Bhediya’ to capture man-eating wolves; and more,Aradhana Kalia,2024-09-03 09:21:09+05:30,"Good morning!

If Monday motivation can uplift you on a Tuesday, you’ll definitely want to read the stories of our para athletes who are scripting history in Paris. India had a medal-rich Monday, one where javelin thrower Sumit Antil bagged the gold by setting a new Paralympic record twice over. Shuttler Nitesh Kumar triumphed over Great Britain’s Brit Bethell to claim the biggest title of his career, while Yogesh Kathuniya earned a silver medal in discus throw.

If not for actual medals, wishing for similar personal wins for you today!

🚨Big Story

On Monday, the Supreme Court flagged concerns about the use of bulldozers to demolish homes of individuals accused of crimes in certain states. While at it, the court announced plans to set nationwide guidelines on the issue.

What is the case?: The court was considering a plea against the demolition drive in Delhi’s Jahangirpuri area after the 2022 riots. Petitioners argued that various state governments were increasingly using bulldozers to demolish the properties of accused individuals. In response, the Uttar Pradesh government’s lawyer stated that demolitions in the state were carried out strictly per procedure.

A flicker of hope: From a juice shop owner in Delhi to a tempo driver in Rajasthan and a loader in Madhya Pradesh, we tell the stories of those impacted by the harsh measures of bulldozer justice. With authorities ignoring their plight, some individuals had to take out loans of up to Rs 15 lakh, while others experienced social ostracism. Can the apex court’s “pan-India” guidelines help them?

Leading the way: In his first term, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath filed cases against around 15,000 people under the UP Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act and demolished the “illegally constructed” homes of several accused. “Bulldozer Justice” thus became a template for other BJP-ruled states, including Madhya Pradesh, Assam, and Haryana. Even Congress leader Ashok Gehlot, who had previously criticized such actions, adopted this approach ahead of the Rajasthan Assembly elections.

Honey Singh addresses rumour of Shah Rukh Khan slapping him; reveals SRK was staunchly against him releasing ‘Chaar Botal Vodka’,Cdata,2024-09-03 09:19:56+05:30,"Honey Singh recently shared the backstory of how he wrote his hit song, “Chaar Botal Vodka.” In an interaction, the singer revealed that the song was penned after he actually drank four bottles of vodka with two of his teammates in Australia. He explained that the song was written in anger after members of the Sikh community protested against his performance while he was on a world tour with Shah Rukh Khan. Honey Singh also mentioned that King Khan had warned him against releasing the song, saying, “Gaaliyan padegi tereko (You’ll get criticized for this).”

He also addressed rumours of Shah Rukh slapping him, and said in an interview with The Lallantop, “I can’t answer this here. You’ll hear about it in my documentary on Netflix.” When pressed further, he clarified, “Nothing like that happened.”

Recalling what led to him writing the song “Chaar Botal Vodka,” Honey said, “I wrote that song after drinking four bottles of vodka with two other people in Australia. I was on a world tour with Shah Rukh Khan in 2013 after Chennai Express’ release and my community, the Sikh community, started protesting. They weren’t allowing me to perform because they were like, ‘Ye gande gane banata hai (He makes dirty songs. He spoils the culture).’ Shah Rukh Khan told me that, ‘I am with you. If you are not allowed, I won’t do the world tour.’ It’s a big thing for him to even say that.” Advertisement Explaining the inception of the song, he shared, “Finally, I went on the tour. I performed. There were some 25,000-30,000 people cheering for me but there were 500 people outside who were burning my effigies. Those 500 people irritated and hurt me. After the show, my choreographer and the dancer came into my room and we started drinking. We started with one bottle. After drinking two-and-a-half bottles, I started creating the beat of the song. I decided to sing the song in a child’s accent. I thought they are telling me that I am ruining their culture, now I will make sure that I will embed this song in their breed and make sure that every kid sings it.” Also read | At Expresso, Javed and Zoya discuss society’s treatment of women, on-screen intimacy Sharing Shah Rukh’s reaction after listening the song, he said, “I made Shah Rukh sir listen to the song and he told me, ‘Tu pagal hai, kya gana banaya hai.

You will get criticised).’ But I was determined mein toh aise he gaunga (I will sing it as it is).” Honey Singh and Shah Rukh Khan worked together in Rohit Shetty’s Chennai Express.

"Woman elopes with 15-yr old, minor booked after she was found dead in vacant building",Cdata,2024-09-03 09:10:37+05:30,"An 18-year-old woman was found dead on the premises of a dilapidated, vacant building at Hay Bunder in Sewri on Monday. According to police, the woman had eloped with a 15-year-old boy, and the couple had been staying in the building together. The mother of the deceased has expressed suspicion regarding the minor boy’s involvement in her daughter’s death.

According to police officials, the girl’s body was found at around 8 am on Monday.

Deputy Commissioner of Police Sanjay Latkar (Port Zone) stated, “Both the minor boy and the girl had eloped from their respective houses nearly two weeks ago. They had been staying together on the fifth floor of the abandoned building, which has been unoccupied for some time.”

The police believe the girl may have either fallen or been pushed from the fifth floor, leading to her death. The girl’s parents and the minor boy’s family were subsequently located and informed.

The girl’s mother suspects that the 15-year-old boy is responsible for her death. However, the boy claims that he was asleep at the time of the incident.

“Upon waking, the boy stated he searched for the woman but found her body on the ground floor. Frightened, he fled to his sister’s house in Kalwa,” an officer reported.

Investigators have learned that the two teenagers had been in a relationship for some time and had eloped on multiple occasions in the past.

"125-unit free power by BJP cost Himachal 1,247 cr in 2 years: CM Sukhu",Saurabh Parashar,2024-09-03 09:06:54+05:30,"The 125 units of free electricity subsidy scheme for all domestic users in Himachal Pradesh introduced by the previous BJP government cost the state exchequer nearly Rs 1,247.75 crore over the past two and a half years, Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu informed the Assembly Monday.

“If we don’t reform the electricity sector, the state government will have to pay Rs 2,200 crore to the Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Department (HPSED) by the end of this year.” the CM said.

Former chief minister Jai Ram Thakur had on April 1, 2022 implemented the scheme in the state.

The state government has, meanwhile, paid Rs 1,247.75 crore as a rollback subsidy to the HPSEB for providing 125 units of free electricity to domestic consumers in the state since April 2022.

Replying to a question by Congress MLA Kewal Singh Pathania, Sukhu said, “The state has at least 16 types of electricity subsidies ongoing. So far, we have withdrawn only one subsidy of Rs 1 per unit given to industries in the state. This subsidy was withdrawn on September 1.

The decision to implement the ‘One House, One Electricity Meter’ policy, where subsidies are given only to those belonging to the BPL families, was aimed at economic reform in the state.”

Attacking the Opposition for introducing several schemes without considering the state’s economic interests, the CM defended his government’s decisions on the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) and the Rs 1,500 scheme for every woman under the Indira Gandhi Pyari Behna Sukh Samman Nidhi Yojna (IGPBSSNY). “We introduced OPS and the Rs 1,500 scheme for the welfare of retired employees and women in the state with due consideration,” he said.

Sukhu, however, dodged the question of how much money the state government would earn by discontinuing the 125-unit electricity subsidy. “It is a complicated issue and is under consideration. A decision will be made after considering all aspects,” he said.

The CM said the state government paid Rs 460.53 crore rollback subsidies in 2022-23, Rs 597.21 crore in 2023-24, and Rs190.75 crore till June 2024.

Chief Minister Sukhu informed the House that the government earned Rs 12,160.68 crore in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Rs 5,840.35 crore in the State Production Tax from April 1, 2022 to July 31, 2024.

Rs 5,259.20 crore in the GST was earned in the Financial Year 2022-23, Rs 5339.89 crore in 2023-24 and Rs 2011.59 crore till July 2024. Meanwhile, Rs 2,147.07 crore in the State Production Tax was earned in 2022-23, Rs 2,631.30 crore in 2023-24 and Rs 1,062.01 crore till July 2024."
"Starlink emerges as fresh battleground between Musk, Brazil",Cdata,2024-09-03 09:02:51+05:30,"Tensions between Brazil and Elon Musk’s business empire ratcheted up further as the country’s telecoms regulator threatened to sanction his satellite broadband company Starlink hours after its top court stood behind a controversial decision to ban social network X from the country.

Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva also backed the top court’s Judge Alexandre de Moraes’ decision to suspend X. The judge found that X allowed postings of hate messages and falsehoods about the country’s electronic voting system that undermined Brazil’s democracy.

“The Brazilian judiciary may have given an important signal that the world is not obliged to put up with Musk’s far-right ideology just because he is rich,” Lula said in an interview with CNN Brasil released on Monday.

Reacting to the judge’s earlier move to freeze Starlink’s accounts for possible use to pay fines owed by X, Musk said in an X posting that he would seek a reciprocal seizure of Brazilian assets, but did not say how.

Starlink on Monday again found itself in Brazilian authorities’ crosshairs by refusing to obey Moraes’ order for all internet providers to block domestic access to X.

A senior official at telecommunications regulator Anatel said sanctions against Starlink for noncompliance could include the revocation of its license to operate in Brazil.

Anatel commissioner Artur Coimbra told Reuters that the regulator is inspecting all Brazilian telecom operators to make sure they have shut down Musk’s messaging platform.

Starlink is the only company that has told Anatel it will not comply with the judge’s ruling, Coimbra said.

Starlink did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.

It previously told Anatel it was refusing to remove X from its service until the freeze on its Brazilian bank accounts was lifted, the telecom regulator confirmed to Reuters earlier on Monday.

Moraes last week froze Starlink’s accounts after X did not pay fines imposed for failing to obey judicial orders.

SIXTH-BIGGEST MARKET

Earlier on Monday, a Supreme Court panel voted unanimously to uphold the suspension of X in the country for defying a court order.

Moraes last week ruled that X should be suspended in Brazil because it did not name a local legal representative as required by law and ignored a deadline for compliance.

Justices Flavio Dino, Cristiano Zanin, Carmen Lucia and Luiz Fux sided with Justice Alexandre de Moraes. Three of the justices on the panel said the suspension could be reversed if the platform complied with previous rulings.

X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the panel’s decision.

X was taken down for most Brazilians in the early hours of Saturday following Moraes’ decision although some people continued to access it through VPNs and other means. Moraes has also threatened to levy a fine of 50,000 reais ($8,902.66) a day on those using VPNs to access the social network, although it remains unclear how enforceable that threat is.

Brazil is X’s sixth-biggest market globally with about 21.5 million users as of April, according to Statista.

Moraes and Musk, who owns a controlling share in Starlink, have been locked in a months-long feud after the social media platform challenged orders to block accounts accused by investigators of spreading misinformation and hate.

While Moraes’ defenders see him as a crusader in the defense of democracy, critics accuse him of using heavy-handed methods on politicians and businessmen.

Musk has argued that Moraes sought to censor users and closed the X office in Brazil in August without appointing a new representative, triggering the suspension.

On Monday, Musk replied, “Exactly,” to a post that described the suspension as an attack on freedom of expression and Brazilians’ rights.

Chief Justice Luis Roberto Barroso, who was not on the review panel, said that removing legal representatives to avoid complying with court decisions “is a behavior that would not be acceptable anywhere in the world.”

Venezuela’s newest news agency says AI anchors protect reporters amid government crackdown,Cdata,2024-09-03 08:54:58+05:30,"One of Venezuela’s newest news anchors sits on a stool, dressed in a flannel shirt and chinos as he delivers the day’s headlines.

He goes by “El Pana,” Venezuelan slang for “friend.”

Only, he’s not real.

El Pana, and his colleague “La Chama,” or “The Girl,” are generated using artificial intelligence, though they look, sound and move realistically.

They were created as part of an initiative dubbed “Operation Retweet” by Colombia-based organization Connectas, led by director Carlos Huertas, to publish news from a dozen independent media outlets in Venezuela and in the process protect reporters as the government has launched a crackdown on journalists and protesters.

“We decided to use artificial intelligence to be the ‘face’ of the information we’re publishing,” Huertas said in an interview, “because our colleagues who are still out doing their jobs are facing much more risk.”

At least 10 journalists have been arrested since mid-June and eight remain imprisoned on charges including terrorism, according to Reporters Without Borders.

“Here, using artificial intelligence is… almost like a mix between technology and journalism,” Huertas said, explaining the project looked to “circumvent the persecution and increasing repression” from the government as there would be no one who could face arrest.

The country’s opposition and human rights groups have said recent arrests of protesters, opposition figures and journalists are part of a government crackdown meant to quiet a sometimes violent, month-long election dispute.

Venezuela’s communications ministry did not respond to a request for comment about the AI journalism initiative. No official has responded to repeated requests for comment by Reuters about the arrests of journalists in recent weeks.

Both the opposition and President Nicolas Maduro claimed victory in the July 28 election.

Maduro, in power since 2013, is backed by the Supreme Court and the electoral authority, which has not published full vote tallies because of what it says was a cyber-attack.

The opposition has shared what it says are more than 80% of vote tallies, showing a resounding win for its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez. Some international observers and many Western countries have said election conditions were unfair and demanded full tallies.

Protests since the vote have led to at least 27 deaths and 2,400 arrests, and detentions of opposition figures and protesters have continued as part of the government’s “Operation Knock Knock.”

Maduro and his administration have called protesters fascists and said they are inciting hate at the behest of countries like the United States, which Washington denies."

Sandhu, a state-level boxer and athlete, who worked as a Punjabi lecturer at GTB National College in Dakha, near his village Chakar, said, “While acting as a mentor to the students in the academy, I got to know more about Kaur Singh and his unsung story. I decided to write about him after meeting Kaur Singh.”

AI has been the central theme at large tech conventions this year, from the CES in Las Vegas and the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona to the annual developer conferences of Apple, Google, and Microsoft. Artificial intelligence will once again be on full display when IFA kicks off on Friday, September 6.

“We have seen a wave of AI product launches and announcements, but for many, AI use cases in these products remain nebulous,” Kane McKenna, a consumer tech industry analyst at CCS Insight tells indianexpress.com. “IFA presents an excellent opportunity for people to get hands-on time with a huge range of AI products and services. I would also expect to see hints of what the next wave of these products has in store, be it improved functionality or more accessible price points.”

Although AI is still in the early stages and use cases are still being developed, computer vendors and chip makers are aggressively pitching PCs tailored to work with artificial intelligence. Insiders and trade pundits expect that AI PCs will be the “hot” topic at IFA, as PC companies will vigorously advertise the merits of AI in the hope of making PCs cool again. Intel will announce the next iteration of its laptop central processor, Lunar Lake, which will make its way into PCs later this year. Analysts expect PC vendors to showcase the next generation of AI PCs powered by Intel AI chips at IFA. Intel has been on a rough patch lately, as its competitors, including Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD, are already shipping cutting-edge AI PCs to the market. However, it remains to be seen how the market will respond to Intel and its chip strategy going forward amid tough competition. Qualcomm, the largest chip provider for smartphones, will also have a significant presence at IFA this year, with the company expected to announce its Copilot Plus AI PCs at a lower cost to boost sales.

“AI PCs are still so new that there is a lot of headway to be made around not just processing power, but also bringing prices to the masses as well as developing new use cases. In my opinion, the lack of mainstream use cases is still the gating factor; I am not expecting to see that change at IFA, but hopefully, I will be surprised,” said Bryan Ma, VP, Devices Research at International Data Corporation.

The computer industry may be on the brink of a tectonic shift with AI PCs. The new-generation AI PCs come with an additional processor or NPU, tailored to speed up AI features such as personal assistants and live transcripts that translate in real-time. However, the use cases are not compelling enough to catalyse a faster upgrade cycle. Industry insiders are hopeful that use cases for AI PCs will continue to emerge, though it remains to be seen how PC companies will differentiate those use cases from what has appeared on smartphones.

Although IFA is a hotbed for big-ticket launches, it has also been a major showcase event for niche technologies and concept devices that may shine a spotlight of their own amid the crowded landscape of AI-heavy gadgets. Last year, LG showcased its bizarre 27-inch TV that packs away into a suitcase, while Honor presented a smartphone with purse straps and an outward-facing foldable display. Lenovo announced its first Windows-powered gaming handheld, the Legion Go (review), at IFA, while Sylvox showed off a television that can actually float on water and is completely waterproof.

McKenna agrees that, like Vegas’ Consumer Electronics Show, IFA has become a home for a lot of the “weird and wonderful” in tech in recent years. He expects a similar trend this year, with IFA serving as a launchpad for niche products and concept devices that will only be on display at Berlin’s major tech show.

But a trend that seems to be growing at Berlin’s annual IFA tech show each year is the increasing presence of robotics companies eager to showcase advancements in robotics by presenting the world’s most advanced robots and humanoids. During last year’s IFA, Desdemona, a humanoid robot entertainer created by AI firm SingularityNet in collaboration with Hanson Robotics, was a major draw among audiences. Desdemona answers questions using a large language model similar to ChatGPT. The company hopes that Desdemona, the three-legged robot, will become a pop star. Another notable robot, Absolut’s Yanu system, is a concept robot pitched as both a bartender and barista, capable of serving up to 100 drinks per hour.

Sustainable consumer electronics are also part of a larger shift happening at IFA, with companies increasingly highlighting them as a key selling point. This was evident in the case of appliances, where energy efficiency is more of a key selling point rather than an afterthought. “Sustainability will also be a key theme, with companies demonstrating their commitment to reducing their environmental impact through eco-friendly products and manufacturing processes,” said McKenna.

But as AI is integrated into more mobile devices and connected appliances, policymakers and regulators are concerned about how the meteoric rise of chatbots like ChatGPT and the upcoming AI features on laptops and smartphones will impact users. Specifically, they worry about whether these advancements will enable greater freedom in carrying out tasks or contribute to the rise of deepfake pornography. The EU has been at the forefront of flagging concerns over the potential for abuse of artificial intelligence, even as big tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and chipmaker Nvidia continue to increase AI investments. Although opinions vary widely on the enforceability of such rules and keeping the big tech in check, experts agree that some sort of regulation of AI is needed.

“AI regulation is likely a significant topic of conversation at IFA 2024,” McKenna says. “I would expect discussions around ethical guidelines on development and use, data privacy, and copyright issues on how foundational models are trained and how we can address biases in AI to ensure that its inclusion into our lives does not exacerbate the discrimination already present in today’s society.”

"PU Student Council poll: Women, their safety issues take centre stage as campaigning gains momentum",Cdata,2024-09-03 08:40:34+05:30,"Written by Shreya Suman & Ajay Raj Singh

With three out of eight contenders being women, a record number of female candidates are vying for the presidential seat in the Punjab University Student Council (PUSC) elections, which are scheduled for September 5.

The women in the list of presidential candidates include Arpita Malik from the BJP’s student wing ABVP, Alka from the Ambedkar Student Forum (ASF), and Sarah from PSU (Lalkaar). Prince Chaudhary from Chhatra Yuva Sangharsh Samiti (CYSS), the student wing of the AAP; Rahul Nain from the Congress’s National Students’ Union of India (NSUI); Tarun Sidhu from the Students Organisation of India (SOI), representing the Shiromani

Akali Dal; are also in the race along with Independent candidates Mukul Singh Chauhan and Anurag Dalal.

Arpita (21) is a BA LLB student who is determined to protect first-year students from being forced into political parties. Her campaign is rooted in the belief that student elections should prioritise student welfare over political career-building, although her specific policies on inclusivity and academic support remain under wraps.

Alka (23), who is a BEd student, is advocating for stronger support for disabled students, post-Matric scholarship, and women’s safety on campus. With five years of experience as an NSS volunteer, the 23-year-old aims to create a more inclusive and accessible campus, and to ensure that professors adhere to their teaching schedules rather than delegating classes to research scholars.

“At ASF, we are dedicated to advancing BR Ambedkar’s vision of equality. Our primary focus is to ensure equal opportunities and rights for everyone on campus, including men, women, and individuals with disabilities,” she said.

Sarah’s campaign focused on rejecting the politics of money and muscle power that often dominate student elections, and instead prioritise on real issues faced by the student body.

“The safety of women on campus is a growing concern, especially with the gedi culture and election-related activities. The lack of basic facilities, such as adequate lighting on the roads leading to the library, exacerbates the issue,” she said. The 21-year-old MA (History) student, who is the presidential candidate from PSU (Lalkaar) has highlighted student concerns such as fee hikes, hostel rights, and scholarship cuts, while also standing against the growing influence of communal forces within the university.

Even male presidential candidates weighed in on women safety. Anurag, 26-year-old PhD candidate in Chemistry, has made women’s safety, academic resources, and campus hygiene his top priorities. His experience as an independent candidate in previous DU elections shapes his approach to improving campus safety through increased police presence, a shuttle bus service, and addressing library overcrowding and mess facilities. The Independent candidate is also focused on implementing the PWD Act of 2016 to ensure inclusivity.

Tarun’s focus is on improving hygiene and safety for women. The 21-year-old mechanical engineering student also wants to expand opportunities for South Campus students. With his extensive experience in PU elections, he also aims to push for increased EWS scholarships and better bus services.

For women, Rahul from NSUI, proposes establishing a dedicated gym and self-defence classes, and collaborating with an NGO to maintain pad vending machines for female students. The 23-year-old LLB student also wants to secure placements for 50 per cent of PU students. He also plans to enhance financial support for students by increasing funds for the “Earn While You Learn” scheme.

Mukul, an Independent Candidate, aims to restore the university’s academic reputation by addressing funding and faculty shortages. His plan includes securing alumni funding, enhancing hostel food safety, and recruiting more faculty. With experience in student welfare, Mukul is also committed to inclusivity and campus safety, advocating for cross-cultural programs and better security.

Prince, from CYSS, is committed to improving campus facilities by centralising training and placement efforts, enhancing health services with full-time gynaecologists and psychologists. The 23-year-old LLB student also wants to improve academic and security infrastructure, by including more reading halls, a renovated library, and 24×7 ground access with enhanced security and lighting.

September 3 will be the last date for campaigning for the PUSC election, which will be held on September 5. The results will also be announced on September 5."
MCD ward committee polls tomorrow: Candidate can’t bring along supporters this time,Cdata,2024-09-03 08:26:43+05:30,"No candidate will be allowed to bring their supporters to the ward committee elections of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), according to the election guidelines issued Monday.

The long-awaited elections are slated for Wednesday. 60 councillors from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress have thrown their hat into the ring for the posts of chairman, deputy chairman and standing committee member in the 12 MCD zones.

Earlier, during the elections of the ward committee, each candidate used to bring their supporters. This year’s guidelines prohibit the candidates from doing so. “No candidate should bring his/her supporters with him/her as neither the supporters nor their vehicles will be allowed to enter the Civic Centre,” the guidelines issued by Municipal Secretary Shiva Prasad said.

BJP MPs accompanied councillors for filing the nomination on Friday. BJP MPs accompanied councillors for filing the nomination on Friday.

The MCD internal elections held between December 2022 and April 2023 saw clashes between the AAP and BJP, leading to several delays. After one such fight, Delhi Mayor Shelly Oberoi had also accused the BJP councillors of allegedly dragging her and attempting to beat her up.

An MCD official said, “Earlier, they (councillors) used to come with their supporters but we don’t want any sort of violence to take place, so this time the councillors will not be allowed to come with their supporters.”

Another senior MCD official said, “One of the reasons to not allow supporters this time is because generally, the elections of three zonal wards used to be held in a single day, this time all 12 ward committee elections will be held on the same day so there wouldn’t be enough space to accommodate so many supporters.”

The ward committee elections are going to take place from 10 am onwards on Wednesday, September 4. The other issued guidelines include: councillors will be allowed entry only after they show their corporation identity cards; electronic devices will be prohibited inside the polling booths; keeping the time limit in mind, no member is allowed to welcome the newly elected office bearers in the assembly hall; media persons will not be allowed in the assembly hall where elections are taking place; and only employees posted for duty will be allowed entry in Sabha Bhawan with identity cards."
Why Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan wants to change name of historic Ravenshaw College in Cuttack,Sujit Bisoyi,2024-09-03 08:24:04+05:30,"Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said that he “personally” believes that the name of the prestigious 156-year-old Ravenshaw University in Cuttack should be changed because the British colonial administrator after whom it is named was in charge during the catastrophic famine of 1866 in Orissa (Odisha) in which more than a million people perished.

Several eminent alumni of the state-run Ravenshaw College — which became a university in 2006 and celebrated its sesquicentennial in 2017 — have opposed the renaming one of the oldest and most iconic educational institutions in the country.

Others have pointed out that Thomas Edward Ravenshaw made a significant contribution to Odisha by his promotion of higher education, and by advancing the cause of the Odia language.

Famine and college

The Na Anka Durbhikshya was preceded by a severe drought in eastern India. The famine hit Orissa the hardest, wiping out about a third of the region’s population. In the aftermath of the deaths and devastation, Ravenshaw, who had been appointed commissioner in 1865, submitted a memorandum asking for the establishment of a degree college in Orissa.

Colonial records suggest that Ravenshaw’s proposal was accepted with the condition that the public should contribute Rs 10,000 towards the college. The Maharaja of Mayurbhanj, Krushna Chandra Bhanja Deo, donated Rs 20,000, which contributed significantly to the growth and sustenance of the institution.

The college was founded in 1868 with intermediate level classes at Cuttack Zilla School (now known as Ravenshaw Collegiate School), which was elevated to a degree college in 1876. The college, which was affiliated to Calcutta University and offered courses in English, vernacular composition, Sanskrit, Persian, logic, mathematics, philosophy, physics, chemistry, and botany, was named after Ravenshaw as a tribute to the British officer, who remained in charge of Orissa until 1878.

Ravenshaw College and Ravenshaw Collegiate School were separated in 1904. The present location of the university — the site of a race course, cricket field, and a preferred venue for sports and festivals that was popularly known as Chakra Padia at the time — was chosen in 1913. A M Millwood was the architect who designed the college building.

Orissa’s first university, Utkal University, Bhubaneswar, started functioning in a portion of Ravenshaw College in Cuttack in November 1943.

A glorious history

Over the decades, Ravenshaw College has produced eminent Odia personalities such as Utkal Gourab Madhusudan Das, Acharya Harihara Das, Pandit Gopabandhu Das, and Pandit Nilakantha Das. Great minds such as P K Parija, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, Annada Shankar Ray, Gopinath Mohanty, and Manoj Das were its alumni.

Former Chief Ministers Harekrushna Mahtab, Biju Patnaik, and Nandini Satpathy, and former Lok Sabha speaker Rabi Ray were students of Ravenshaw College at different times.

Besides being the nerve centre of higher education, Ravenshaw College became a driving force in the civic and political life of Orissa. The literary movement of Sabuja Juga was heralded by the writings of young students of the college such as Annadashankar Roy, Kalindicharan Panigrahi, Baikunthanath Patnaik, Saratchandra Mukherjee, and Harihar Mahapatra. Ravenshaw College faculty often spoke at the Utkal Sahitya Samaj.

When Orissa became a separate province on April 1, 1936, Sir John Austin Hubback was administered the oath of office of Governor at the Ravenshaw College Hall, now called Heritage Hall. The first Provincial Durbar was held at the College Hall on January 9, 1937, and the first Legislative Assembly of Orissa started operating from the Hall on July 28 that year."
Paris Paralympics: Archer Rakesh Kumar’s guts and determination rewarded with mixed team bronze,Nitin Sharma,2024-09-03 08:12:30+05:30,"Darshana Devi still remembers January 21, 2009, the day her son Rakesh Kumar met with a car accident while returning from Jammu to their village Natali near the temple town of Katra. The accident resulted in Kumar being paralysed from waist down and he would spend months in recovery as he made sense of the setback.

On Monday, as the 39-year-old archer and compatriot Sheetal Devi won the bronze medal in the mixed team compound event with a 156-155 win over Eleonora Sarti and Matteo Bonacina of Italy at the Paris Paralympics, Darshana could not hold her emotions back.

“Rakesh had gone to meet his aunt at village Bantalab near Jammu and on his return, the shared cab met with an accident. He suffered spinal cord injuries. From Jammu hospital, he was taken to Amritsar where doctors performed a surgery. It was a tough time for the whole family but this Paralympics medal has given the biggest joy to us,” she told The Indian Express.

Prior to the accident, the then 24-year-old worked as a plumber in the village while assisting father Pritam Chand in his carpentry work. After the mishap, Kumar was bedridden for more than a year before the family got a second-hand wheelchair to assist him in his daily chores. With their village located near Katra railway station, the base town for pilgrims to the Vaishno Devi shrine, the family set up a mobile sim shop for Kumar.

“He never complained about what had happened to him, and wanted to start earning again. We rented a small shop opposite our home on the main road where he sold mobile sim cards and other small stuff to earn some money,” remembers Devi.

It was in 2016 that archery coach Kuldip Vedwan, on his way to nearby Jammu, saw Kumar managing his shop on the highway and approached him to try his hands at archery. With the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board running a sports complex in the temple town, Kumar was one of the early trainees at the sprawling campus. A ninth-place finish at the 2018 Nove Mesto Para Archery tournament in Czech Republic, where he also won the team silver along with Shyam Sundar and Tarif, was followed by his maiden appearance at the Para Asian Games in Jakarta, where he finished ninth in the individual event.

Kumar would pair up with Jyoti to finish sixth in the mixed team event at the Tokyo Paralympics in 2021 apart from a sixth place in individual event.

“Initially, he would manage the shop and train for more than six hours a day as he was not sure whether the sport could help him earn a living. But as his interest grew, he would spend his time at the archery range from 7 am to 7pm. His brother Deep Kumar, who operates a taxi, also helped him with money. When he would travel from the village to the sports complex on a scooter that he modified to travel with his kit, some people would laugh at him but his medals are the biggest answer,” says Devi.

Last year, Kumar paired up with Sheetal Devi to win the mixed team gold at the Hangzhou Asian Games apart from winning a silver each in the men’s individual and team events.

Last year, Kumar was appointed assistant coach by the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board.

“Rakesh bhaiyya’s will power is his biggest strength. While Kuldeep sir worked on his basics first, he always understood the importance of being physically fit. Before starting training at 7am, he would run the wheelchair on the road for 2-3 km apart from lifting weights and stretching with thyro bands for strengthening his shoulder muscles,” says Amit Thakur, a Khelo India silver medallist archer and trainee at the complex.

Kumar is building a new house near their old one in the village. “His father died two years ago. He would have been the happiest to see him winning medals for India,” shared the proud mother."
Govt sets up 23rd Law Commission for legal reforms,Cdata,2024-09-03 08:11:10+05:30,"The Union Government Monday set up the 23rd Law Commission for a period of three years to identify laws that have become obsolete and can be repealed, carry out audits of laws that affect the poor and give its views on any law that the Law and Justice Ministry conveys to it.

The commission would include a full-time chairperson, four four-time members, the Secretaries of the Legal Affairs and Legislative departments as ex-officio members and up to five part-time members. The government was yet to appoint the members.

Similar to the terms of reference of the 22nd Law Commission that was created in 2020, the new panel has been tasked with examining “the existing laws in the light of Directive Principles of State Policy and to suggest ways of improvement and reform and also to suggest such legislations as might be necessary to implement the Directive Principles and to attain the objectives set out in the Preamble of the Constitution.” Advertisement The Commission has also been asked to “examine the impact of globalization on food security, unemployment and recommend measures for the protection of the interests of the marginalized”, which was also in the terms of reference of the previous Commission. The terms of reference include reviewing the system of judicial administration to make it more responsive to the demands of the time. The panel’s goals include eliminating delays, simplification of rules of High Courts for sake of uniformity and ease of understanding, and implementation of a framework for case flow management.

"Rajinikanth, Jiiva, Karthi’s non-answers on Hema Committee report: Silence of the superstars, and the growing chasm between Q & A",Avinash Ramachandran,2024-09-03 08:06:00+05:30,"We love to hear stars talk, and most stars love to talk. Through their films, they talk to us. Through audio launches, they talk to us. Through their “Ask me anything” sessions on social media, they talk to us. They use these platforms to announce their next films, hint about their political plans, take a ‘friendly’ dig at their perceived rivals, and narrate stories about their journeys in the hope and knowledge that we would lap it all up. But then… Many stars see this as a one-way street. They will talk. You will listen. And more often than not, ‘you’ also includes the press and media. We are in a place where stars are so powerful that they decide the place, the topic, the duration, and most of the times, what makes the final cut. It is in these trying times that a journalist has to ply their wares and ask questions that reflect the mood of today’s society.

Accessibility is a major concern for journalists, especially on the entertainment beat, considering exclusivity is the name of the game for all the superstars of cinema. Many celebrities who used to be a message or a call away when they started out in the business, become inaccessible over time. This is a phenomenon that all entertainment journalists understand. Honestly, it isn’t like journalism is flawless. It isn’t like all journalists are beacons of societal change or sacrosanct. But for people who still believe in the power of the fourth estate, questions are the only weapon in their arsenal. Since the time Justice Hema Committee report was revealed to the public last week, there has been relentless coverage of the issue. It has not just been restricted to Kerala media, but has reached all parts of the country. It has been the debate on many primetime shows, the topic of contention in various sections of social media, and the dinner-table conversations in many households in the country.

The fire raging in Malayalam cinema is now finding its path through the various industries, including Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi. It is but a given that every actor, who meets the press for any reason whatsoever, will be asked a question pertaining to the Hema Committee Report. Call it sensationalism if you want, but it is important that we know what our beloved stars want to say about this development concerning women’s safety and security in cinema. In Kerala, the silence of Mammootty was considered more deafening than the din surrounding the never-ending chaos the report created. That is why, it was even more shocking when Rajinikanth said, “I don’t know about it” when he was asked about the same almost ten days since the report was made public. And the likes of actor-politicians Kamal Haasan and Vijay are silent too. As actor Raadika Sarathkumar pointed out in an interview to Sun News, “Many top actors of Tamil cinema found the time to write a post about the F4 racing in Chennai, but it is appalling to see them observe radio silence on the Hema Committee report.”

Tamil cinema might live in an echo chamber with many important voices dismissing the Hema Committee Report as a Malayalam industry thing. Let’s for a moment buy this argument. Okay, this is not a Tamil cinema problem. But what is the name of the actors’ union in Tamil cinema? It is not language specific as AMMA (Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes). Here, it is called Then Indhiya Nadigar Sangam (South Indian Artistes Association), so it is very much their problem too, right? When the General Secretary Vishal was asked about it after his birthday function, he said an investigating body similar to the Hema Committee in Kerala will be constituted by the Nadigar Sangam in Tamil Nadu. Then why does Karthi, the treasurer of this organisation, not talk about it during the press meet of his next film, Meiyazhagan. Responding to the media at the event, he said, “This is not the place to have this conversation.” Recently, actor Jiiva, who called it a ‘Malayalam cinema issue’ got into a verbal altercation with a journalist, and called him ‘foolish’ to ask about “an inauspicious thing during an auspicious event.” He was opening a new shop in Theni, Tamil Nadu. Even actor-politician Suresh Gopi said, “Ask me a question about AMMA when I walk out of the AMMA building. When I walk out of the party office, ask me about politics.” These responses create an impression that there is a time and place for asking such questions to our mostly inaccessible stars. So, when do we ask questions? Where do we ask questions? What questions can be asked? Will everything be policed by celebrities now? Of course, the image of journalists have taken a hit because of certain sections not asking the right questions at the right time. It is a fair assessment too. But wherever possible, never stop asking questions. That is the least we can do.

Once again, this is a seemingly free society, and the right to question is what has propelled civilization for all these years. There is a duty to answer, and a right to answer. A person can always not answer the questions that are asked to them. That is their personal right, and no one has the right to infringe on that right. Feigning ignorance seems better than being dismissive of the question. If the stars are indeed living in a bubble, and not feigning ignorance, then they can obviously ask for time to understand the situation, and come up with an answer. Also, many celebrities, who have a lot to lose, and are still losing a lot, have stepped up to the plate. They are sharing their opinions when asked because they understand that this is a watershed moment in Indian cinema. When you are an influential actor, and when your fellow colleagues are fighting for their right to be heard, their right to work, their right to justice, their right to opportunity, then silence might not cut it. There is now a duty to answer.

Again, questioning someone for their opinion about a pertinent issue isn’t always to crucify them. It could be a source of comfort for many survivors to find the strength and space to tell their stories. It could be the required boost for the changes to be made at breakneck speed. Of course, it could also become a content for trolls. It could be misconstrued or misrepresented or misjudged or sensationalised. Probably why it is all the more important for these stars to share their opinion on this issue. I repeat, it isn’t like journalism is flawless. It has its problems, and journalists should be, and are, held accountable for every word that is being written or said. But at the end of the day, it is the intention to tell the story and the truth that matters. It is the same for the stars too.

Clear the air, and talk to the people who are waiting to hear you talk. The stars know their influence on people looking up to them. Yes, the ardent fans will see this move as a “fire move” of shutting down journalists, and hence perceived sensationalism. But there are scores of people who are on the fringes waiting for a ray of light to guide them. Don’t wait for an audio launch, a social media ‘AMA’ or your film’s release to talk about an issue affecting your own brethren. Just like the people that stars ‘save’ in their films, here too are survivors in need of a hand to hold or shoulder to feel support. They still believe a hero would come to save the day. The least they can do is talk."

In The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger and a Forgotten Genocide (2013), Gary Bass showed that to weaken the Soviet Union in the Cold War, the US was looking to “open the Chinese door”. Pakistan was the only country which was close to both the US and China. The US sought Pakistan’s mediation, and to support Pakistan in the civil war, President Richard Nixon ended up sending the Seventh Fleet to the Bay of Bengal.

Western artists and non-governmental sectors had a different view. America’s newspapers supported the liberation struggle. Two musical events revealed where the sympathy of artists lay. George Harrison, an ex-Beatle, not only wrote a song, ‘Bangladesh’, which became a top-10 single in Britain, but also sponsored a “Concert for Bangladesh” at New York. Joan Baez, already known for her opposition to the Vietnam war, also wrote a song, ‘The Story of Bangladesh’. Its opening verse became famous: Bangladesh, Bangladesh/Bangladesh, Bangladesh/ When the sun sinks in the west/ Die a million people of the Bangladesh”

Ironically, Pakistan’s attempt to prevent an independent Bangladesh was deeply rooted in an ethnic bias. Ayub Khan, Pakistan’s military ruler between 1958 and ’69, outlined the prejudice in his book, Diaries of Field Marshal Mohammad Ayub Khan, 1966-1972. Attachment to Bengali as a language, he stressed, exemplified inadequate Muslimness, excessive Hinduisation and a largely uncultured life. Urdu, for him, was a Muslim language and Bengali a Hindu one. “They are consciously Hinduising the language and culture. Tagore has become their god. Everything has been Bengalised, even the plate numbers on vehicles are in Bengali.” Further, “their urge to … revert to Hindu language and culture is close to the fact that they have no culture or language of their own, nor have they been able to assimilate the culture of the Muslims of the Subcontinent by turning their back on Urdu.” Much like the colonial masters, West Pakistan would rule East Pakistanis, “civilise” them, and make them adequately Muslim.

By the end of 1971, helped by India’s intervention, Bangladesh liberated itself from such colonial desires. Its leader, Sheikh Mujib, formed the government and the 1972 Constitution declared that Bangladesh would be secular, in which all religions would be respected, not simply Islam. And Bengali, of course, would be the national language.

But soon, the news took a dark turn, both economically and politically. In 1974, a famine took anywhere up to 1,00,000 lives. Stories of Bangladesh’s mass poverty started replacing those that India had been stuck with. To many, Kissinger’s dismissive term for Bangladesh — “a basket case” — began to look all too real.

In 1975, Sheikh Mujib was assassinated with his whole family, with the exception of two daughters who were abroad. One of them is the now deposed Sheikh Hasina. Military rule for roughly a decade and a half followed. Secularism was dropped from the Constitution and an Islamic national identity proclaimed by the new state elite. After the early 1990s, civilian rule intermittently returned and the two main parties, the Awami League (AL) and the Bangladesh National Party (BNP), alternated in power. The former was more secular, the latter more Islamic. Finally, in 2011, under Sheikh Hasina’s AL government, the 15th Constitutional Amendment restored secularism. But this was done in a way that also recognised Islamisation as a growing social reality. The Amendment kept Islam as a “state religion”, while assigning “equal status” to all religions and prohibiting “the abuse of religion for political purposes”.

This contestation between religious/ethnic/racial equality and majoritarianism is reminiscent of such struggles in several other countries — such as the US (White majoritarianism vs racial equality), France (what Stanley Hoffmann called “ethnic Frenchness” vs equal citizenship) and, of course, India (secular nationalism vs Hindu nationalism). To say that Islam has risen as a force in Bangladesh and minorities have often felt insecure is beyond doubt, but to say that secularism is dead and minorities have no place in the nation is not true. The reality is somewhere in between.

This duality came through recently as well. There were attacks on the Hindu minority and the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami was lifted, but Mohd Yunus, upon assuming charge of the interim government, unequivocally stated that the state was committed to protecting the minorities. It is noteworthy that the BJP state governments have made no such statements, even as lynchings and bulldozer demolitions have continued.

Communalism is a social project in Bangladesh, promoted by some right-wing groups. It is not a state project, though it was under the military and BNP rule. The difference between social and state projects is important. Neither the outgoing AL government, nor the interim one, called Bangladeshi Hindus “termites” or “infiltrators”.

By the early 2000s, the story of Bangladesh took a positive turn. The Grameen Bank created by Yunus became a microfinance model for the Global South. It was also endorsed by Bill Clinton (and later Barack Obama). Yunus got the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.

Finally, a fitting response to Kissinger’s “basket case” epithet came in the last 15 years. By 2023, the per capita income of Bangladesh ($2,529) was higher than that of India ($2,489), let alone Pakistan ($1,407). By 2021-22, its literacy rate (76 per cent) had also caught up with India and was far ahead of Pakistan (58 per cent in 2019); and its infant mortality rate (24) eclipsed India’s (26), and left Pakistan (51) far behind.

If all of this happened under Sheikh Hasina, why did she fall? She ignored a decades-old lesson — that exceptions notwithstanding, economic growth without sufficient job creation, coupled with an authoritarian repression of dissent, is insufficient for political legitimacy. If the army, after a point, refuses to shoot at mass protests, the end can only be near. Rulers in the Global South and beyond should pay attention.

Express View on Hanumankind: The big stepper,Cdata,2024-09-03 07:45:21+05:30,"The word on the street is that Not like us — a diss track by Pulitzer-winning American rapper Kendrick Lamar, one of the more influential rappers of the times — is the best of its kind. It became the fastest rap song to reach 700 million streams on Spotify besides leading the Billboard Global 200 for two consecutive weeks. But what Lamar, or the entire international world of hip hop did not anticipate, perhaps, is that the 17-time Grammy-winning rapper’s sharp-tongued track will be outstreamed by the meteoric rise of Big dawgs from India, where rappers, however talented, are not even in the vicinity of the rap map.

Created by Bengaluru-based Malayali rapper Sooraj Cherukat aka Hanumankind, Big dawgs found a distinguished placement on Spotify’s “Global Hip Hop List”. What worked was a combination of swag and sway, and the daredevilry in a rickety Maut ka Kuan (Well of Death) — a typical carnival attraction in India — in Kerala’s Ponnani where the song is shot with the rapper positioned in the centre of the velodrome bouncing off some gnarly beats; Cherukat was rapping in English, accent in place. But the appreciation was soon replaced by shock that the piece came from India, along with racist attacks online. The song, however, kept becoming bigger, breaking boundaries globally."
Yogendra Yadav writes: Ten half-truths about caste census,Yogendra Yadav,2024-09-03 07:43:43+05:30,"Karl Mannheim, the Hungarian sociologist who founded the sub-discipline of sociology of knowledge, used the word ideology in a peculiar way. For him, “ideology” refers to false beliefs or mental fictions that serve to veil the true nature of a society. His usage of the word, or his quest to reduce ideas to their social base, did not become popular outside a tiny professional circle. But if you are looking for one example that would fit Mannheim’s description, our current debate on caste census would be a good candidate.

Every encounter with otherwise liberal and even progressive educated Indians on this issue leaves me shocked. I hate to trace people’s beliefs to their accident of birth, but the staggering display of ignorance, prejudice and arrogance on this issue forces me to remember that the opinion-making class in our country is still largely upper caste. This kind of “ideological” opposition to the caste census takes the form of many self-serving half-truths. Each contains a grain of truth, but they are presented in a way that masks the real truth.

Here are the 10 most common half-truths on the caste census:

One, India has never had a caste census since 1931.

Advertisement

True, the Census of India has not asked the caste of every respondent after 1931. But the sense of scandal is misplaced. Every decennial census in independent India has always asked the caste question and recorded whether the respondent belongs to the SC or ST category. Not just that, the census also records the exact jati of SCs and STs and publishes jati-wise information on educational and economic indicators of SC and ST.

Two, caste census is a new-fangled idea of Rahul Gandhi.

True, the political will that the Congress party has displayed on this issue is recent and seems largely due to Gandhi’s conviction. But there is nothing new or partisan about this demand. This recommendation was made by the Ministry of Social Justice and the Registrar General and Census Commissioner in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. In May 2010, the Lok Sabha debated this issue and unanimously — with unqualified endorsement by the BJP — supported a nationwide caste census. In 2018, then Home Minister Rajnath Singh promised the inclusion of OBCs in the next census. Parliamentary committee on social justice and statutory bodies like the National Commission for Backward Classes have recommended it, as have state governments, including NDA government in Bihar.

Three, the caste census is a humongous exercise that might delay the census.

True, extending the caste question to all castes would require modification to the existing proforma used to collect census information. But this is not a big deal. All it would take is to reword Column 8 of the Household Schedule as follows: “CASTE: 8(a) Which social group does this person belong to: SC/ST/OBC/General 8(b) If SC/ST/OBC write name from the list supplied, if General write name of the caste in full”. That’s all. This does not require even a reformatting of the existing Schedule used in 2011.

Four, we don’t have a ready list of all castes to count, it’s an impossible task.

True, we don’t have an official list of all castes and sub-castes in the General group. But we do have ready lists for nearly three-fourths of our population — SC, ST and OBC. As for General, the census will simply record the exact jati mentioned by the respondent which will be categorised later — just as it does for language and religion. We don’t have to start from zero — we already have the 1931 Census and the 90-volume People of India, an encyclopedia on all castes and tribes of India produced by the Anthropological Survey of India.

Five, caste census is all about a caste-wise headcount of the population size of each caste.

Advertisement

True, that is the most immediate and publicised finding of a caste census. But the most significant data from the caste census is about the social, economic and educational profile of each caste community at each administrative level. The caste census would reveal the jati-wise break-up on age structure, sex ratio, educational level, occupation, house-type, major household assets and access to water, electricity and cooking gas. This is exactly the kind of data that the SC has mandated for authentic and evidence-based social policy.

Six, caste census excludes non-Hindus and would force everyone to adopt a caste.

This is a plain lie. There are castes within every religious community — Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh etc. The “caste census” of Bihar enumerated over a dozen Muslim castes, as have caste surveys in other states. The caste question in the census would record caste irrespective of religion. Inserting caste in the census would not prevent anyone from recording that they have “no caste”, just as the religion column permits “no religion”.

Seven, the caste census is just about wanting to expand the existing quotas.

Advertisement

True, that is what many of the advocates have in mind. And there is nothing illegitimate about it, if the census indeed shows a serious mismatch between the share in population and the share in resources and opportunities for a caste or community. But the caste census is crucial for many other policy questions: Do we need sub-classification of SC/ST/OBC quotas? Should some castes be excluded from the benefits of the OBC quota? Do we have a “creamy layer” within SCs or STs? How should the creamy layer be defined for OBCs? What is the extent of poverty within the “upper caste”? And has caste become too obsolete to understand social inequalities? Anyone, pro or anti-reservation, who seeks answers, would demand a caste census.

Eight, the caste census is needed for SC/ST/OBC, but not for General castes.

True, the principal impulse behind the caste census is to understand the nature and extent of maldistribution of resources, assets and opportunities suffered by communities at the receiving end of the caste system. But we cannot measure the disadvantages without a benchmark, without documenting the privileges of the “General”. Unmasking the privileges of “upper caste” Hindus in every walk of public life is essential to fulfilling the constitutional mandate of ensuring equal opportunities.

Nine, the caste census is an invitation to caste politics and intensified social strife.

Advertisement

True, recording an identity in official documents tends to solidify it. But let’s not forget that this is already being recorded in one form or another for three-fourths of our population. Let’s not forget how the remaining one-fourth classified its matrimonial ads. Besides, a caste census would not reveal anything that a local politician does not already know and use. And if routine census questions on religion and language do not create social strife, we must not assume that caste would.

Ten, the caste census is limited to including caste in the decennial census.

True, that’s the most common understanding of the caste census. But a comprehensive caste-wise inventory of assets, facilities, resources, opportunities and representation would require the caste question to be inserted into several other census-like data collection exercises, most of which already ask the caste question in terms of broad categories. These include the Economic Census, Agriculture Census, All India Survey on Higher Education, Household Consumption Expenditure Survey, Periodic Labour Force Survey by NSSO and the list of directors of registered companies, besides a survey of all public sector employees.

How biodiversity can increase the resilience of cities,Radha Goenka,2024-09-03 07:40:36+05:30,"If you had to choose between living in a thriving forest full of organisms, including apex predators, or in a desert with barely any life, where would you choose to live? Your chances of survival would be higher in the forest. It provides the ideal conditions for life, with shade from the scorching sun, and easy access to water and food. But of course, you would have to overcome your fears.

Forests are complex ecosystems of diverse organisms that interact with each other. At an individual level, all living organisms in the forest are motivated to survive and reproduce. Yet, they are all connected and play a critical role in maintaining a fine balance in the larger ecosystem.

In the early 20th century, the Yellowstone National Park in the US was in a deplorable condition with a large part of its land barren with dying plants. In an experiment to restore its ecosystem,135 grey wolves, which were heavily hunted and almost extinct, were reintroduced to the park. In the years before the re-introduction, the large deer and elk population led to overgrazing, increasing soil erosion and widening of the rivers. This, in turn, set off a chain reaction of further destruction. The grey wolf, the park’s apex predator, hunted the overly populated deer and elk population and restored the balance of the original ecosystem. The reintroduction of the wolves led to the revival of the thriving national park we know today.

More than 75 per cent of flowering plants globally need insects and animals to pollinate them. They cannot multiply without pollinator insects like butterflies and bees. Besides the complex interdependence of the plant and animal kingdom, there is the fascinating fungal kingdom, which connects trees and plants. Fungi, which include mushrooms, are mostly on the roots of plants and trees. Many scientists believe trees talk to each other, through this underground network. Research shows that if a tree gets attacked by a disease, it alerts neighbouring trees. Depending on the threat’s severity, trees either brace themselves with a protective barrier or disconnect from the infected tree. The underground communication network is coined as the “wood wide web”.

Every organism in nature plays a critical role in creating a balanced ecosystem. As human beings, we are only one part in this larger ecosystem and are beginning to understand this only now.

Observing nature makes you realise that nature is very intelligent, hence the term “Natural Intelligence”. Just like Artificial Intelligence, we have only scratched the surface in our understanding of it. Step back and think about the complexity of the way the human body functions: How a single human cell creates energy or how each of us has a unique genetic code. In the plant kingdom, think about how a plant uses a green pigment “chlorophyll” to create energy from the sun.

Humans have been investing resources on trying to understand how the human body behaves and finding ways to change how it behaves through medicine for centuries. We realised humans have a genetic code only 200 years ago and are only beginning to even understand how genes work now. At a collective level, how we interact with each other is another story. Philosophy has been trying to understand human behaviour with each other, again for centuries, and yet we are confounded by the unpredictable behaviours and motivations of our species, clearly evident from wars and crimes.

A thriving forest ecosystem houses different types of plants, animals, fungi and microorganisms — different from a human-made green park. The diversity of the forest builds the resilience and adaptability of an ecosystem. A thriving biodiverse ecosystem not only provides for clean air, water and food but also helps us cope with natural disasters, diseases, and climate change.

So how do we build biodiverse spaces?

Studying trees and organisms that are native to an area is the first step and then reintroducing native plants and organisms to encourage restoration of original ecosystems is one way. And of course, there is protection of forests.

Mumbai is home to remarkable biodiversity. With a thriving biodiverse protected forest, the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, within its city limits and large amounts of mangroves and wetlands on its coast, the city has a lot of native land and marine biodiversity. Of course, the recent over-concretisation of the island city, with excessive buildings and roads is posing a grave threat to this biodiversity. But, we can take action to protect and enhance the biodiversity of a city like Mumbai.

To counter the coastal erosion, we can protect mangroves and natural marine habitats. We can invest in more sewage treatment plants that treat the waste the city disposes into the oceans and invest in new initiatives like artificial reefs that could enhance marine biodiversity. For land biodiversity, we should plant native species of trees and plants that exist in the Sanjay Gandhi National Park. We can create habitat corridors so the organisms that are in the park can multiply, expanding the ecosystem of the park into the city. A “green corridor” can be created and help reap the benefits of climate mitigation.

Medellin in Colombia, created a similar network of green corridors. It led to cleaner air and a drop in two degrees of temperature in the city.

With the creation of the Mumbai Coastal Road, connectivity in the city has been enhanced. We have a rare opportunity to create a biodiverse green corridor in the reclaimed area between the road and land. This along with planting of native trees could connect the biodiversity of Sanjay Gandhi National Park to the entire city.

Similarly, a conscious focus on land and marine biodiversity across the country could greatly help address the climate issues we face today.

Express View on judicial delays: Time for reform,Cdata,2024-09-03 07:40:17+05:30,"On August 20, 32 years after a case of blackmail and sexual abuse of hundreds of girls came to light in Ajmer, a POCSO court in Ajmer convicted and sentenced six persons to life imprisonment. On August 29, Delhi High Court allowed a complainant to withdraw a case after she spoke of the burden of repeatedly having to miss work due to court appearances — a situation the Bench described as “litigation fatigue”. These two cases, in two different courts, illustrate the problem that President Droupadi Murmu sought to highlight in her address at the two-day National Conference of the District Judiciary. Calling it the “Black Coat Syndrome” she spoke of “poor people of the villages” being reluctant to go to court, fearing the financial and mental strain of a prolonged judicial process. She said, “How many days can it take? Thirty-two years, 12 years, 20 years, two years… One should think deeply about this.”

With the President calling for a solution to fix the “culture of adjournments”, it is about time that the longstanding problem of judicial delays got the urgent attention it deserves. It is the outcome of a system stretched to its limits, a conjunction of inadequate resources, especially manpower, and a caseload that grows each year: According to information available on the National Judicial Data Grid, over five crore cases are pending across different levels of the system. Contributing to the challenge are structural issues, such as the large shortfall in the number of judges: At just 15 judges per 10 lakh people, the figure is far less than the 50 judges per 10 lakh recommended by the 120th report of the Law Commission in 1987. Also in short supply are support staff, who are essential to the timely and efficient function of courts. While there have been attempts to unclog the system, such as by the addition of more courtrooms, an updated e-filing system and strategies like pre-litigation dispute resolution, like the Lok Adalats, they have not made a dent."
"India’s GDP growth, beyond the headline numbers",Soumya Kanti Ghosh,2024-09-03 07:35:31+05:30,"GDP growth in the first quarter fell short of the RBI’s expectations. At 6.7 per cent, growth is still higher than the decadal average of 6.4 per cent for the first quarter. Economic activities were clearly influenced by seasonal factors and the general elections during that period.

Despite the low number, the Q1FY25 throws up more positive trends than what the headline estimate suggests. Demand shows a largely positive picture with all heads except valuables showing positive growth. Private consumption grew by a robust 12.4 per cent in current prices. Robust consumption data reaffirms that the rural rebound remains strong. An uptick in agricultural growth in subsequent quarters on the back of a better monsoon will provide a strong impetus. Investments also registered a healthy growth of 9.1 per cent in current prices with investment rate at 31 per cent. Government expenditure registered a growth of 4.1 per cent, which was slower but it must be kept in mind that the general election was held in the first quarter. For example, government spending fell by close to 20 per cent quarter-on-quarter. Spending is, however, likely to have revived in the second quarter.

Adjusting for inflation, the expenditure heads show traction in private demand and capital formation. Exports registered a growth of 8.4 per cent while imports slowed considerably both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis on account of slowdown in oil demand and decline in imports of valuables such as gold.

On the supply side, gross value added grew by 6.8 per cent and the gap between GDP and GVA shrank to merely 19 basis points as compared to an average gap of 122 bps in preceding three quarters. Core GVA, a component of private demand, also registered a growth of 7.3 per cent.

Agriculture grew by a mere 2 per cent. However, the normal monsoon bodes well for kharif crop sowing and soil moisture retention in the coming months. La Niña conditions, originally expected to emerge in August, may now arrive by November. This will impact food CPI aiding consumption. The performance of the broader industry was robust with electricity and others, and construction registering double digit growth. The momentum in services also continued but at a slower pace. However, the strong growth in electricity should not distract us from discom reforms. Accumulated losses by many state discoms need to be tackled.

How does the 6.7 per cent number impact the outlook for the year? The RBI projected GDP growth for the full year at 7.2 per cent, based on a first quarter growth of 7.1 per cent. We believe that RBI’s estimate of 7.2 per cent still looks reasonable.

Recent data indicates a moderation in bank credit growth, though credit has increased to industry which is a positive for the economy and has a multiplier effect on employment and growth. Overall, the economic momentum remains intact. The rebalancing of demand from private consumption to investments supported by government capex needs further support. Private investment activity looks robust and domestic monetary conditions remain supportive of growth this year. A rate cut is on the cards and can come by the end of 2024 or early 2025.

As 7 per cent plus growth for the current year looks possible, the government should move ahead with the implementation of the nine priorities it had mentioned in the budget in a time-bound manner. These could be bucketed in a list of short and medium term priorities. We mention only two of them here.

The Budget had announced a self-financing guarantee fund with a cover of up to Rs 100 crore. It may be noted that the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) had a corpus of Rs 41,600 crore that generated an additional lending of Rs 4.5 lakh crore to the MSME sector. Thus, say with a Rs 10,000 crore corpus and 100 per cent guarantee like ECLGS, this new scheme has the potential of additional MSME loans of Rs 1 lakh crore. Maybe, we can also launch a credit guarantee fund for the agricultural sector in subsequent budgets with the completion of digitisation of land records.

Additionally, the idea of banks using their own in-house capability to assess MSMEs for credit eligibility by using tax payments and even tax returns is an innovative idea. This transition will enable banks to truly own the customer value chain. Ultimately, this could culminate in banks building a UPI-like model for financing SMEs — through integration with CBDT/GST/EDI data.

Digitisation of land records in rural areas and linking them to the farmer registry is a move that could potentially benefit 7.4 crore farmers having operative KCC accounts. It may be noted that digitisation has been completed in 95 per cent of 6,57,397 villages. Once the farmer registry is completed, the data can be effectively used for unique lending to farmers and could ensure a bulge in agri-credit growth. There is now a genuine demand for loans with higher ticket sizes than the current RBI permissible limit of Rs 1.6 lakh sans collaterals.

In urban areas, the digitisation of all land records with GIS mapping could supplement the efforts of state governments in terms of updating, maintaining and administering property taxes and going completely faceless and making the process automated. This could potentially change the financial position of urban local bodies. Currently, 50 per cent of the own tax revenue of municipalities comes from property taxes.

So what should not be done? In states like Punjab, the groundwater level of three-fourths of the blocks falls under the over-exploited category, while only 13 per cent of blocks are in the safe category. Thus, running the MSP in its present form is undesirable for all stakeholders. Instead, the focus should be to build agri value chains. A calibrated adoption of the recommendations of the 2021 committee headed by Challa S Setty of SBI is needed.

"Congress may renominate majority of its Haryana MLAs, list likely by Wednesday",Asad Rehman,2024-09-03 07:25:28+05:30,"The Congress’s Central Election Committee (CEC) met on Monday to discuss ticket allocation for the Haryana Assembly elections, with sources saying that 41 seats remain to be finalised. The party is likely to renominate a majority of its 28 sitting MLAs, according to sources in the CEC, and expects to release the names of all 90 candidates by Wednesday.

It is learnt that the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, suggested that a “few Congress workers should also get tickets and not just established leaders”. A source in the CEC said Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge would take a call on whether to field MPs Randeep Singh Surjewala and Kumari Selja, While Surjewala is a Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan, Selja won the recent Lok Sabha election from Sirsa.

After the CEC meeting, All India Congress Committee’s (AICC) Haryana in-charge Deepak Babaria said, “A list with 49 names was given by the screening committee for Haryana to the CEC. A total of 34 names have been cleared, while 15 are pending.” Advertisement Babaria said a review committee would have a look at the 15 seats that the CEC had not finalised yet. The screening committee is likely to meet at 7 am on Tuesday and discuss the seats for the 41 constituencies for which it has not yet sent its recommendation to the CEC, which will reconvene on Tuesday evening. “The meeting of the CEC will continue tomorrow and the remaining 41 seats which are left will be discussed. We hope that by Wednesday, our list will be out. We will release all the names together,” Babaria said. Asked about the criteria for selection of candidates, the Congress leader said those with a “good image” were being given a chance apart from them having their names in the survey in a good position. “Those who have lost two elections will mostly not get tickets,” he said. Asked about sitting MPs being in the fray, he said: “I have not been told about them by the party high command.” On August 28, Babaria said the party would not allow its MPs to contest the elections. The remarks came after Selja and Surjewala expressed a desire to contest the polls. The following day, Babaria did a U-turn saying that “anyone who has the support of the MLAs and blessings of the party high command can be in contention for the chief minister’s post”.

Express View on export ban on food commodities: Monsoon comfort,Cdata,2024-09-03 07:23:13+05:30,"A good southwest monsoon — India has received 7.5 per cent above-long period average rainfall in the current season from June, with 9 per cent and 15.3 per cent surplus for July and August respectively — has led the Narendra Modi government to loosen anti-inflationary restrictions on food commodities. On August 29, the ban on sugar mills to produce ethanol directly from cane juice, syrup or intermediate-stage “B-heavy” molasses, imposed last December, was lifted. Mills/distilleries have also been allowed to use up to 2.3 million tonnes (mt) of rice from the Food Corporation of India’s stocks for ethanol production, after they were barred, since July 2023, from purchasing these in the latter’s open market sale auctions. The moves reflect the government’s comfort vis-à-vis the domestic availability of sugar and rice for human consumption as well as bio-fuel production. This comes amid expectations of bountiful monsoon-enabled bumper crops of paddy and sugarcane to be marketed/crushed from October-November.

But much more needs to be done. The Minister for Consumer Affairs and Food Pralhad Joshi has said that the government is “thinking” of relaxing the prohibition on white non-basmati rice exports, also effective since July 2023. Given the 45.5 mt of rice in public warehouses on August 1, the highest ever for this date, and farmers on course to plant a record area under paddy, there isn’t much scope or time to think. The government must, in fact, even dispense with the 20 per cent duty on parboiled non-basmati and $950/tonne minimum export price restrictions on basmati shipments. It should, likewise, permit resumption of sugar exports — stopped completely since May 2023 — given that mills will start the new season from October with some 9 mt of stocks, as against 5.6 mt a year ago. Not removing export curbs now would cause unmanageable problems of plenty in rice and sugar down the line. The same goes with the present export ban on onions and stockholding limits on pulses. These should go at the earliest, as farmers have significantly expanded acreages under these crops this time in response to both good rain and prices."
"Today in Politics: After Netflix content head, will I&B ministry summon Anubhav Sinha over IC-814 series row?",Cdata,2024-09-03 07:15:14+05:30,"As the Netflix documentary “IC-814: The Kandahar Hijack” has triggered a political slugfest, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting summoned the OTT platform’s content head of India, and conveyed that they must keep religious sentiments and sensitivities of the public in mind.

According to Divya A’s report, while the government has no immediate plans of banning the series, it has asked officials at Netflix to find a way to douse the controversy. It may also summon the filmmaker Anubhav Sinha, sources have said.

The depiction of hijackers of the Indian Airlines flight from Kathmandu to Delhi has stirred controversy with a section of viewers objecting to the ‘humane’ projection of the perpetrators.

“Nobody has the right to play with the sentiments of the people of this nation. Indian culture and civilisation should always be respected. Should we allow any foreign people to slipshod over our cultural values,” the source said without elaborating.

The sources said filmmakers have to think before portraying something in a wrong manner. “You may be liberal, but you cannot portray institutions in a wrong manner,” the source said.

In context: The documentary has landed in controversy after BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya said the hijackers of the flight were dreaded terrorists, who acquired aliases to hide their Muslim identities. “Filmmaker Anubhav Sinha, legitimised their criminal intent, by furthering their non-Muslim names. Decades later, people will think Hindus hijacked IC-814,” Malviya posted on X.

Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said it was really amusing to see the people who took movies like “Kashmir Files” as the gospel truth having a meltdown at the way the events of IC-814 are depicted in the Netflix show. “Now suddenly they want accuracy and nuance packaged in the script,’ Abdullah said on X.

Shiv Sena (UBT) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi said the “right-wing outrage” over the IC-814 TV series was a reminder of the BJP government’s massive failure then. “… it reminds the nation how the intelligence and government agencies were caught off guard. Much like the Kargil war too,” she said.

Can you reduce heart attack risk by 20 per cent with catch-up sleep over weekends? Understanding a new sleep study model,Dr Rajiv B Bhagwat,2024-09-03 07:14:14+05:30,"Sleeping like a log over the weekends for long hours can make up for the damage done to your body by a lack of sleep during the week, according to an exhaustive 14-year study done by the State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease in China. Those who got the most ‘catch-up’ sleep, found researchers, had a 20 per cent lower risk of developing heart attacks and strokes than those who remained sleep-deprived.

Undoubtedly, this research on the impact of compensatory sleep, which used data from nearly 91,000 people who reported sleeping less than seven hours every night, is significant. But the question is whether this is practical enough to follow. The bigger question is whether weekend lie-ins can indeed be a replacement for a regular good night’s rest. For that, let’s understand the link between sleep and heart health.

WHY IS SLEEP NEEDED FOR HEART HEALTH

Sleep is the time your body rests and repairs itself. A person’s heart rate and blood pressure drop while sleeping as their breathing becomes stable and regular. Besides, the less you sleep, the greater the time when your stress hormone cortisol is active. While it is needed for your metabolism and fighting off crisis situations and stress, consistently high levels of cortisol mean your body would get used to it. Excess cortisol can lead to inflammation, release more chemicals that trigger platelet aggregation and blood clotting. This in turn can lead to clot formation in heart vessels.

It can also affect the production of hormones that help regulate blood sugar levels. This can lead to insulin resistance and other cardiovascular risks.

IS SLEEPING IT OFF OVER THE WEEKEND REALLY POSSIBLE?

Although the results validate weekend sleeping, this solution may not be practical. That’s because it would require really long hours of sleep over the weekend to offset your sleep deficit. Which means, your other relaxation and socialisation activities will have to take a backseat every weekend. Is that sustainable? Also a National Sleep Foundation study in 2023 had shown it takes a much longer time to recover from a single hour of lost sleep, so you definitely need more than 48 hours of the weekend to make up for five days of sleep deprivation every week.

Besides, sleep hygiene demands that you be consistent with the time you wake up and sleep. If you break that pattern all of a sudden on a weekend, it is disruptive for your body, affecting your metabolism. If you wake up late, you will sleep late and have shortened sleep for Monday morning when you need to be thoroughly rested.

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine advocates sleep regularity even when you’re on vacation.

Therefore avoid sleep deficit in the first place, and try to build your own boundaries of when to fall asleep to get at least six to seven hours of sleep. I avoid stimulants like tea, coffee and sugar late evening. You can include hot milk, multigrain roti and eggs for your last meal as they are rich in tryptophan, an amino acid that helps in the regulation of the sleep hormone melatonin. Diet can help you maintain sleep schedules."
"As the wolves of Bahraich evade drones, nets and cages, 35 UP villages live in terror",Manish Sahu,2024-09-03 07:12:31+05:30,"Everything took place in a matter of seconds, say locals. A thud broke Meera Devi’s sleep around 3 am on a Monday. Still half asleep, she suddenly realised that her two-year-old daughter Anjali, who had slept next to her the night before, was missing.

Before Meera could raise an alarm or wake up her sleeping husband, the wolves had already sneaked out of the couple’s doorless brick house with Anjali. Two hours later, her mutilated body was found in a nearby sugarcane field in Bahraich district’s Gurudutt Singh Purwa village.

Over the past two months, a pack of six wolves had been targeting people, mostly children, in 35 villages of Mahasi tehsil in Uttar Pradesh’s Bahraich district after sunset. Besides Anjali, the wolves have attacked three adults in the last 24 hours, say forest officials. They added that the animals grab the children by the mouth as they carry them away.

Between July 17 and September 2 (Monday), the wolves have killed eight persons — including seven children under the age of eight years — and injured 18 others. The first fatality — a one-month-old boy — was reported on July 17 in Sikandarpur village. The state has announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh each to the families of the deceased.

Since the attacks began, the forest department launched ‘Operation Bhediya (Wolf)’ to capture the animals. Manoj Sonkar, Conservator of Forests, Devipatan division, told The Indian Express on the phone, “About 1.5 months ago, our thermal cameras and drones detected six wolves in the affected areas. We also found their pug marks.”

Though the initiative resulted in the capture of four wolves — two males and two females — between August 3 and August 29, two wolves continue to evade the officials.

Early on August 31, the two wolves were spotted by drones near Kolaila and Sisayya villages. Teams were quickly dispatched to the spot and the area cordoned off by the police. According to Additional Principal Chief Forest Conservator Renu Singh, who has been in Bahraich for nearly a week, multiple teams from both the range and divisional levels have been deployed to capture the two wolves.

Over the past few days, forest officials have reported sightings of the two wolves in a 5-km radius. Twenty-five forest teams, each comprising a ranger, forester, guard and watcher, have been deployed across the affected villages. Additionally, three divisional forest officers from neighbouring districts, along with range and sub-divisional forest officers, are monitoring the animals’ movements. Nets and cages — designed to resemble a sitting or sleeping child — have been “strategically” placed, based on information obtained from the four drones equipped with thermal cameras that are currently tracking the wolves. To attract them, officials are using goats and life-size dolls dressed in colourful attire as bait.

On rounds in a forest department jeep to check preparations at Sisayya village around 3 pm, Bahraich Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Ajeet Kumar Singh says one of the four captured wolves had died “due to a heart attack caused by stress”.

As the jeep enters the restricted area, the DFO says two of the captured wolves have been sent to Lucknow zoo and the third to Gorakhpur zoo. Instructing the vehicle to stop at a secluded spot, just past a barricade, DFO Singh starts walking towards a sugarcane field to speak to his colleagues stationed there.

Upon his return a few minutes later, he remarks, “All preparations are in place to capture the animals, but it seems the wolves have not been spotted here again. Not even by our drones.”

(Express photo by Manish Sahu) Sidhu Kumar of Sisai Churamani village in Uttar Pradesh’s Bahraich district lost his seven-year-old son in a wolf attack on August 4. (Express photo by Manish Sahu)

He adds that a forester armed with a tranquiliser gun has been stationed nearby in case the wolves are sighted.

To a question on why Mahasi tehsil, located about 80 km from the Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary and 55 km from Saryu river, is witnessing these attacks, Conservator of Forests Sonkar says, “I think these wolves originally lived near a river that gave them access to prey and water. I think they moved closer to human settlements after their natural habitat got flooded. Scarcity of natural prey is driving them to attack humans and they seem to have developed a taste for human flesh.”

In a statement on Monday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed that efforts be made to “control and capture man-eating wolves at all costs”. Emphasising the need for awareness, he instructed the administration to spread awareness by putting up hoardings at religious places, schools, markets and government buildings.

Minister of State for Forest and Environment (Independent Charge) Arun Kumar has been directed to deploy additional foresters in Bahraich, Sitapur, Lakhimpur, Pilibhit, Bijnor and other districts to increase joint patrolling and manage crowds in case the wolves are captured. The minister has advised the residents to avoid sleeping outside, keep children indoors and ensure that their doors are securely locked at night. He has also recommended travelling in groups and carrying sticks for protection till the remaining wolves are captured. Locals say the administration has installed doors in houses that were missing the same.

Despite these measures, the terror associated with these animals in the belt has surpassed the fear invoked even by tigers and leopards. After the first attack on July 17 in Sikandarpur village, the wolves struck 10 days later, on July 27. They attacked a two-year-old girl sleeping outside the house with her mother in Nakwa village. The girl’s mutilated body was found in a nearby sugarcane field about two hours later.

Late on August 4, a wolf entered a house in Sisai Churamani village and grabbed a sleeping seven-year-old boy. The boy’s body too was found in a nearby sugarcane field. On August 26, wolves took away a five-year-old boy sleeping next to his mother in Raipur village.

Late on August 31, eight-year-old Paras and Kunnu Lal, 55, were attacked by wolves. According to the boy’s mother, they released her son as soon as she raised an alarm. Both Paras and Kunnu have sustained injuries, and are undergoing treatment.

On Monday, Kamla Devi, 58, sustained injuries on the neck after she was attacked by a wolf inside her unlocked house in Barabigha village. She says the animal fled as soon as raised an alarm.

Despite regular visits by government officials, terrified locals have taken to locking their children inside their houses while they work in their fields. To ensure their little ones do not wander outside at night, the women have started tying their saree’s pallus to their children’s limbs. The residents have also started returning home before sunset and staying indoors all night.

Armed with iron rods, sticks and torches, men in groups of 10 have been patrolling the villages at night for the past two weeks, says Shobha Ram, the husband of Nakwa village pradhan Kudiya Devi.

Sharda Devi, 70, who lives in Gauri village, says the women and children have started staying indoors all night and opening the door only when the men return in the morning.

To keep the wolves out, locals have installed lights and loudspeakers at various locations in the village. Firecrackers too have been used occasionally to keep the animals away.

The attacks led to a temporary dip in attendance at the local school. “The attendance has improved now that four wolves have been captured,” says Sunil Kumar, a teacher at the government primary school in Baggar village.

Camping in the affected villages, Mahasi BJP MLA Sureshwar Singh says, “The wolves have affected around 70,000 people in a 20-km radius.”

Calling two of the eight deaths “suspicious” — since the animals did not “consume the victims’ flesh” — forest officials said investigations are on to ascertain the causes of these two deaths."
BJP slams Congress for expelling leader over ‘casting couch’ claim,Cdata,2024-09-03 07:07:03+05:30,"The BJP Monday slammed the Congress for expelling former AICC member Simi Rose Bell John from the party after she alleged “exploitation” and “casting couch” in the party, asserting that in any other organisation this would have led to an inquiry.

Citing Hema Committee report, BJP leader Rajeev Chandrasekhar said: “I draw your attention today, given these unfortunate happenings, to a senior lady leader of the Congress in Kerala, Simi Rose Bell, who has alleged that there is exploitation in the Congress, and when she points out that there is a casting couch in the Kerala Congress, she is summarily dismissed from the party… In any other place in India, if a woman in the workplace raises an issue of sexual harassment, it is the bounden duty of the organisation under the law to constitute a committee, a Visakha committee, to investigate the accusations of harassment…”

“This is the same Congress party where Rahul Gandhi would go to J&K and say women had talked about rape and harassment. When it comes to his own party, the Congress in Kerala, which has a long list of dubious records of complaints from women, he does nothing,’’ he said. Advertisement Recalling that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had coined the slogan ‘ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon (I am a girl; I can fight)’, Chandrashekhar said that in reality, the Congress chose not to investigate the charges made by a woman and removed her from the party. On Sunday, Congress in Kerala expelled Rose Bell from the primary membership of the party after she alleged that one has to be willing for exploitation for opportunities in Congress. KPCC chief K Sudhakaran said in a statement, “She had raised the allegation to insult women leaders in Congress. She was removed as her act was found as an act of grave indiscipline.”

"At Expresso, Javed and Zoya discuss society’s treatment of women, on-screen intimacy",Komal Rj Panchal,2024-09-03 07:02:55+05:30,"Lyricist-writer Javed Akhtar joined his daughter and filmmaker Zoya Akhtar for the third session of Expresso, held in Mumbai Thursday. Javed and Zoya reflected on a wide range of topics — the state of Hindi cinema, the evolution of stardom, how societies that exalt the mother figure treat women, and, of course, Amitabh Bachchan.

“In any society where there is a lot of premium on the mother, it means women are in a bad shape. They are in trouble. ‘Ma ki pooja hone chahiye (we should worship Ma).’ But what about the women you don’t worship, who also coincidentally include your wife? Okay, people should respect my mom but what about the mother of my kids? This is all rubbish. They put so much premium on mothers so they can misbehave with other women,” Javed said."
Kolkata rape-murder case: Junior doctors seeking Police Commissioner’s resignation stage dharna,Sweety Kumari,2024-09-03 06:57:36+05:30,"Hundreds of junior doctors protesting over the rape-murder of a female colleague at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital sat on a dharna on Monday near the Kolkata Police headquarters at Lalbazar, demanding the resignation of Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal.

Earlier, iron barricades were put up on BB Ganguly Street to stop the marching protesters who insisted that their delegation be allowed to meet Goyal or he should come to meet them.

They started the march from College Square in Central Kolkata at 2 pm. The protesting doctors also alleged inaction on part of the city police in stopping vandalism at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 14.

The protesters carried a replica of a spine and red roses, asserting that these were to emphasise the duty of the police force to protect citizens. “We have brought a replica of the spinal cord as a symbol of the Police Commissioner’s lack of spine. He has failed to provide justice to the victim and her family,” said a protester.

Accusing the Police Commissioner of being “incompetent”, the doctors expressed their frustration over the lack of progress in the investigation in the matter and the way it was initially handled. “We have been protesting peacefully for 23 days. We have been demanding his resignation since day one but to no avail. We will not back down until our demands are met,” said another protesting doctor.

Despite attempts by the police to disperse the crowd, the junior doctors did not move from the site and stayed put. They sat down in the middle of the road, blocking traffic,

and vowed to continue their agitation.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) Indira Mukherjee said, “Protest marches to Lalbazar are stopped at BB Ganguly street. If they want to meet the Police Commissioner, they will be allowed to do so.”

Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Rupesh Kumar, who was at the spot, said, “Protesters marching to Lalbazar are stopped here. Usually, people in such large numbers are not allowed to go beyond this point as prohibitory orders are in place in the Lalbazar area. They earlier said that a delegation will meet the Police Commissioner but changed their stance.”

The agitating doctors also burnt an effigy of the Police Commissioner. They also raised slogans, seeking exemplary punishment to the perpetrators of the rape and murder at the RG Kar Hospital.

The doctors have alleged inadequate steps by the police during its probe into the August 9 rape-murder of the young doctor, before the investigation was handed over to the CBI by the Calcutta High Court. A large number of police personnel were deployed in the area.

Meanwhile, former Union minister Nisith Pramanik was arrested on Monday after BJP workers clashed with police in Cooch Behar during a demonstration against the alleged rape and murder of a doctor in the state-run RG Kar Hospital early last month.

The party workers held rallies in various districts of Bengal during the day to protest the death of the on-duty medic that sparked nationwide outrage.

Rallies were held before offices of district magistrates in Bardhaman, Malda, Cooch Behar and Jhargram, among others.

Yemen’s Houthi rebels target oil tanker in the Red Sea,Cdata,2024-09-03 06:47:34+05:30,"An attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeted an oil tanker in the Red Sea on Monday, authorities said, as a second ship nearby also came under fire. Both attacks were near where crews hope to salvage a tanker loaded with oil and still ablaze after another assault by the group.

The attacks are believed to be the latest in the Iranian-backed rebels’ campaign that has disrupted the $1 trillion in goods that pass through the Red Sea each year over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip as well as halted some aid shipments to conflict-ravaged Sudan and Yemen.

Meanwhile, the efforts to salvage the still-burning Sounion seek to head off the potential ecological disaster posed by its cargo of 1 million barrels of crude oil.

In Monday’s first assault, ballistic missiles hit the Panama-flagged oil tanker Blue Lagoon I, and a third exploded near the ship, the multination Joint Maritime Information Center overseen by the U.S. Navy said. “All crew on board are safe (no injury reported),” the center said. “The vessel sustained minimal damage but does not require assistance.”

This frame grab from video released by the Ansar Allah Media Office, the media arm of Yemen’s Houthi rebels. (AP) This frame grab from video released by the Ansar Allah Media Office, the media arm of Yemen’s Houthi rebels. (AP)

The Houthis said late Monday that they had carried out the attack on the Blue Lagoon I using “a number of missiles and drones,” because of its owners’ use of Israeli ports. The Blue Lagoon I is traveling south through the Red Sea to an unlisted destination.

The vessel was coming from Russia’s port of Ust-Luga on the Baltic Sea and had been broadcasting that it had Russian-origin cargo on board.

In recent months, the Blue Lagoon I traveled to India, which gets more than 40% of its oil imports from Russia despite Moscow’s ongoing war on Ukraine and the international sanctions it faces over it.

The Greek-based firm operating the ship could not be immediately reached. The Joint Maritime Information Center said it assessed the ship “was targeted due to other vessels within its company structure making recent port calls in Israel.”

Later on Monday morning, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center reported a second attack off the Houthi-controlled port city of Hodeida.

The private security firm Ambrey said an aerial drone hit a merchant ship, though no damage or injuries were reported. The attack happened only a few kilometers (miles) from where the Blue Lagoon I attack happened, Ambrey said.

The Houthi group did not immediately claim responsibility for the second attack. However, it can take the rebels hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults.The Houthis have targeted more than 80 vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October.

They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a United States-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the US or the UK to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.

Meanwhile on Monday, a salvage effort appeared to be underway to tow away the Sounion oil tanker, which was earlier hit by the Houthis and abandoned by its crew. Jamel Amer, an official with the Houthis, wrote online Saturday that tug boats assigned to pull the Sounion away should arrive Sunday.

However, NASA fire satellites showed a blaze at the site where the Sounion had been abandoned on Monday morning.

Later photos published by the European Union’s Operation Aspides naval mission in the Red Sea of the Sounion taken Monday showed no tugboats near the still-burning vessel. “Private companies are involved in the salvage operation that is about to start,” the operation said.

“Upon their request, EUNAVFOR ASPIDES will provide protection to the tug boats, that will deal with the salvage operation and facilitate their efforts to prevent an environmental disaster.”It added: “Currently, several fires continue to burn on the vessel’s main deck. The vessel remains anchored without drifting, and there are no visible signs of an oil spill.”

The Sounion was carrying some 1 million barrels of oil when the Houthis initially attacked it on Aug. 21 with small arms fire, projectiles and a drone boat.

A French destroyer operating as part of Operation Aspides rescued the Sounion’s crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, after they abandoned the vessel and took them to nearby Djibouti. Last week, the Houthis released footage showing they planted explosives on board the Sounion and ignited them in a propaganda video, something the rebels have done before in their campaign."

Netanyahu resists ceasefire despite protests and pressure from US,Unknown,2024-09-03 10:15:50+05:30,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed back against growing calls for a ceasefire in Gaza on Monday, despite massive protests in Israel and increasing pressure from US President Joe Biden.

The demands come after nearly 11 months of ongoing conflict and the discovery of six more dead hostages.

Protests and public outcry over hostage deaths

In his first public address since the protests, Netanyahu insisted on maintaining Israeli control over the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip along Gaza's border with Egypt.

Israel believes this corridor is used by Hamas to smuggle weapons into Gaza, though Egypt and Hamas deny the claim.

Netanyahu described the corridor as vital to preventing Hamas from rearming, calling it the group's ""oxygen."" He also emphasized his commitment to the hostages, stating, “No one is more committed to freeing the hostages than me...No one will preach to me on this issue.”

Netanyahu faced intense criticism from Israelis, who took to the streets on Sunday night in what appeared to be the largest protest since the conflict began.

Many of the demonstrators, grieving and angry over the deaths of the hostages, blamed Netanyahu for not reaching a deal with Hamas that could have saved lives. A rare general strike was held across the country on Monday in response.

Thousands of protesters gathered outside Netanyahu’s private residence in Jerusalem, chanting for a deal and carrying coffins draped in the Israeli flag.

Scuffles broke out as police removed the coffins, leading to several arrests. Additional protests occurred outside Netanyahu’s Likud party headquarters in Tel Aviv.

However, some Israelis continue to support Netanyahu's stance, believing that continuing the military campaign in Gaza will force Hamas to meet Israeli demands.

Pressure from the US

Meanwhile, Biden expressed frustration with Netanyahu's efforts, stating that the Israeli leader was not doing enough to resolve the situation. Biden noted that negotiations were close to a deal but stressed the need for a quicker resolution.

Hamas’ new hostage policy

Adding to the tension, Hamas’ armed wing announced on Monday that they had implemented new instructions since June on how to handle hostages if Israeli forces approach.

The statement followed the Israeli military's recovery of six hostages' bodies from a tunnel in Gaza, with Hamas claiming the hostages were shot as Israeli forces neared.

Netanyahu vowed to make Hamas pay a heavy price for the killings and rejected accusations from Hamas that Israel was responsible for the hostages' deaths.

He reiterated his commitment to a military solution, while Hamas insists on a deal that includes a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners.

Despite ongoing efforts, Israel and Hamas are yet to reach a deal that would end the conflict and secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza."

"J&K poll fray heats up as PCC chief Karra fielded from Central Shalteng, BJP president Raina to contest Nowshera",Arun Sharma,2024-09-03 06:30:05+05:30,"The Congress on Monday released its second list of six candidates for the upcoming Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections, fielding J&K Pradesh Congress Committee (JKPCC) president Tariq Hameed Karra from Sringar’s Central Shalteng constituency.

The party is contesting the three-phase polls – scheduled for September 18, September 25 and October 1 – in alliance with the National Conference (NC).

The Congress’s Monday list involves constituencies bound for polls in the second phase, of which only Karra’s seat falls in the Valley.

In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, Karra had defeated NC chief Farooq Abdullah by over 40,000 votes in Srinagar as the PDP candidate. A fierce critic of the PDP-BJP alliance government, he later quit as an MP in protest against civilian killings in Kashmir in 2016. He joined the Congress next year.

He had served as the finance minister during 2005-08, when the PDP-Congress coalition government was in office.

Karra became the first Congress leader from the Valley to be inducted as a Congress Working Committee (CWC) member.

In the 2014 polls, the Central Shalteng seat was won by Karra’s former confidant Noor Mohammad Sheikh on the PDP ticket. Sheikh later shifted to the Altaf Bukhari-led Apni Party after the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019. He recently resigned from the Apni Party, deciding to contest the seat as an Independent candidate.

The Congress has also fielded former minister Shabir Khan from Thannamandi (ST) constituency, Mumtaz Khan from Reasi, Bhupender Jamwal from Mata Vaishno Devi, Iftikhar Ahmed from Rajouri (ST) and Mohammad Shahnawaz Choudhary from Surankote (ST).

Shabir Khan, who had also won the 2008 election, is currently the vice-chairperson of the Rajouri District Development Council (DDC).

Mumtaz Khan, former MLA from Gulabgarh, is the son of a prominent Gujjar leader Haji Buland Khan. Mumtaz and his brother Ajaz, ex-legislator, were among the Apni Party’s founding members. Mumtaz recently returned to the Congress fold. His brother-in-law and former minister Chowdhary Zulfikar has been fielded by the BJP from the Budhal constituency.

Shahnawaz Choudhary was known as a baiter of Ghulam Nabi Azad when the latter was with the Congress. He is now an elected member of the Poonch DDC.

The Congress has fielded Bhupinder Jamwal from the newly-created Shri Mata Vaishno Devi seat. He has been the president of the pony wallas and pithu union, which operates between Katra town and Mata Vaishno Devi shrine in Trikuta Hills.

On Monday, the BJP also released its fourth list of six candidates for the second phase, fielding its J&K unit president Ravinder Raina from the Nowshera seat and party general secretary Vibodh Gupta from the ST-reserved Rajouri constituency. The other four party candidates will be in the fray from the Kashmir region.

In 2014, Raina had defeated the PDP’s Surinder Choudhary by 10,000 votes from Nowshera. Gupta was elected to the erstwhile J&K Legislative Council in 2015.

In the Valley, the BJP has fielded Aijaiz Hussain from the Lal Chowk seat in Srinagar. Hussain is a DDC member.

The party nominated Ali Mohammad Mir from Khansahib in Budgam. It also announced little known candidates, Arif Raja and Zahid Hussain from the Eidgah seat in Srinagar and the Chrar-e-Sharief seat in Budgam, respectively.

The jailed Independent MP Engineer Rashid’s Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) also released its second list of 10 candidates for the second and third phases, who will contest as Independents.

The AIP has pitted former Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI) president Sheikh Ashiq as its candidate from Ganderbal against NC leader and ex-CM Omar Abdullah. The party has also fielded former trade union leader Ishtiyaq Qadri from Habakadal and Mohammad Maqbool Beig from Hazratbal.

The banned Jamaat-e-Islami Jammu and Kashmir, which has nominated four Independent candidates for the first phase of polls, is fielding Dr Kaleemullah Lone as its candidate from North Kashmir’s Langate seat, which is up for polls in the third phase.

Kaleemullah is the son of Ghulam Qadir Lone, a member of the Jamaat’s eight-member panel, which has decided to return to the democratic process and has been engaged in talks with the Centre to get the ban on the outfit lifted."
"US Presidential race becomes close, Kamala Harris maintains narrow lead over Trump: Poll",Unknown,2024-09-03 06:27:05+05:30,"With fewer than 10 weeks remaining for the upcoming US Presidential elections, the race to the White House is becoming close with Vice President Kamala Harris maintaining a narrow lead nationally over former President Donald Trump.

The surveys were conducted after President Joe Biden’s exit from the 2024 presidential race, after the Democratic convention, and after independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. endorsed former President Donald Trump.

The polls and surveys have changed significantly while closing the gap on issues where Republican candidate Donald Trump has been leading and maintaining a narrow margin for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris nationally.

The polls are reflecting the changing mindset of the US voters since until President Biden was in the fray, former President Trump was leading in polls with a narrow edge.

Also Read | Trump vows to fight ‘anti-white feeling’ in US. His allies have a plan

The latest Wall Street Journal poll shows Vice President Harris leading nationally with 48 percent support of registered voters while Trump remains at 47 percent.

Another poll by Quinnipiac University showed Kamala Harris enjoying 49 percent support and Trump trailing at 48 percent.

Also Read | President Biden ends re-election bid, endorses Kamala Harris as Democratic Party nominee

One outlier poll by Suffolk/USA Today suggests that Kamala Harris is ahead with 48 percent support base while Trump is left behind at 43 percent, and 9 percent are undecided voters. This poll indicates that Harris’ popularity is eclipsing Trump’s earlier gains during Biden’s bid to contest the polls.

The Trump-Harris debate scheduled on September 10 on ABC News would be a crucial game changer in these polls as the narrow margin could shift either way, like it happened post June 27 when Biden was supposedly decimated in the debate on CNN against Trump."
"Delhi HC refuses relief to CM Kejriwal, other AAP leaders in defamation case by BJP leader",Sohini Ghosh,2024-09-03 06:26:09+05:30,"The Delhi High Court Monday refused to quash proceedings in a defamation case by a BJP leader against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and three other Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders. “This court is of the considered opinion that there is a fine distinction between legitimate criticism of the policies of a political party or the government or an organisation and intentional malicious imputations, which may be defamatory,” underlined the HC as the AAP leaders were denied relief.

The defamation case pertains to the AAP leaders’ remarks about the alleged deletion of the names of 30 lakh voters belonging to some communities from electoral rolls in the Capital.

The High Court noted that “the issue highlighted by the petitioners regarding discrepancies in the list of voters prepared and uploaded on the website of Election Commission may have been crucial and critical from the perspective of citizens but imputing that the exercise of deletion of names of certain communities was at the instance of the BJP clearly exhibits that the imputations were made with malafides”.

“Prima facie, the imputations lower the reputation of the BJP and undermine the trust of the voters in the said party,” the court of Justice Anoop Kumar Mendiratta held.

The court directed the CM and other AAP leaders — minister Atishi, Sushil Kumar Gupta, and Manoj Gupta — to appear before the trial court on October 3. The case was filed by BJP leader Rajeev Babbar.

The High Court went on to record: “Under the constitutional scheme, citizens have a right to know the truthful and correct information to form an appropriate opinion about the social processes. However, at the same time, a political party cannot be permitted to sponsor the print media for political purposes, thereby stinging mud and making mischievous, false, and defamatory imputations on the rival political parties.”

In March 2019, a Delhi court issued summons to the Chief Minister and the three other AAP leaders in a case filed by Babbar, the then BJP Delhi unit vice-president, who alleged that they had tarnished the BJP’s reputation by blaming the party in tweets and press conferences for alleged deletion of names of voters of some communities from electoral rolls.

Earlier on August 30, Justice Mendiratta pronounced the verdict in a case linked to Congress leader Shashi Tharoor where he refused to quash the criminal defamation proceedings initiated upon a complaint by Babbar as well, and held that “BJP is a determinate and identifiable body”. Referring to the same judgment, Justice Mendiratta reiterated that the defamatory imputations by the AAP leaders are clearly in respect of an “ascertainable class‟ or “body‟, and thus held that Babbar is competent to file a defamation complaint.

“… a political party hardly has any role in addition or deletion of the names in the voters’ list, as the said task is assigned to the Election Commission to be taken in accordance with law… The imputations clearly imply that the BJP entered into corrupt or unethical practice, which could adversely influence the public opinion against the BJP,” the court noted in its 33-page verdict."

He emphasised that the government is committed to safeguarding lives of all tizens and directed that comprehensive security measures be implemented in wildlife-sensitive districts.

He said that patrolling by trained teams should be intensified in these areas. Where necessary, additional manpower should be deployed, and the availability of essential equipment must be ensured. The meeting was also attended by the Forest Minister, Chief Secretary, Director General of Police, Additional Chief Secretary Home, Additional Chief Secretary Forest, all ADG Zones, Divisional Commissioners, and District Magistrates.

During the meeting, the Chief Minister stated, “In recent times, there have been incidents of attacks by man-eater wolves and leopards in certain areas of the state, resulting in loss of life. This situation must be brought under control as soon as possible.” He emphasised that efforts should be made to control and capture these wild animals, utilising technical support where needed. The CM also directed that a separate action plan for relief and rescue operations be developed, taking into account the specific circumstances of each district.

The CM sought an update on the situation from the Forest Minister, who recently returned from tours of Bijnor and Moradabad and instructed him to visit Pilibhit and Lakhimpur Kheri.

He emphasised the need for extensive public awareness to safeguard against wild animal attacks, instructing that information on safety measures be disseminated through the administration, police, forest department, panchayats and revenue departments."

Blaming previous governments for “anomalies in conduct of competitive examinations, Adityanath alleged that whenever dates of competitive exams were near, “chacha-bhatija jodi” used to start “extorting money”, leading to the youths of the state missing out on government jobs. He was addressing a district-level mega employment and loan fair at Aryabhatta International School.

Claiming that Uttar Pradesh now has the second-largest economy of the country and that it would become the leading economy in the next few years, Adityanath claimed that in the next two years, two lakh youths would get government jobs in the state.

However, targeting Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal Yadav without taking their names, the CM alleged that because of the “uncle-nephew” team’s mischief, job appointments used to get stuck in court cases. He also alleged that in the past, government jobs bore the brunt of such “extortion”, leaving youths unemployed and forcing many to migrate to other states in search of employment.

Assuring that the “double engine government” would give both “security and respect” to people, Adityanath asked to be cautious of “vibhajankari takaten” (divisive forces), who are creating a divide in the name of caste but when they come to power, they bow down before rioters and do “appeasement”.

The CM alleged that both the Congress and the SP have torn the “social fabric of the country as well as the state by exploiting caste, opinion and religion for petty political gains.”

At the employment fair, 100 companies offered over 15,000 job opportunities to the youths of Moradabad, while the Chief Minister distributed loans totaling Rs 175.50 crore. He also gave tablets to 2,500 youngsters.

Adityanath also inaugurated and laid foundation stone of 292 development projects worth Rs 401 crore for Moradabad district. Of these, 156 projects were dedicated to the Kundarki Assembly alone.

He pointed out that the newly appointed officers in the UP Police, recognised as the world’s largest civil police force, must embrace “smart policing” in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision. “We have to move towards smart policing, which is techno-savvy and trendy, which is strict but also sensitive, modern but also mobile, alert but equally accountable towards work, reliable as well as responsive.”

He noted that with the recruitment of 1.60 lakh personnel in the police force over the past seven years, there has been a significant increase in the resources available to the force now.

Adityanath cited an adage often associated with the police force: “The more you sweat in training, the less blood is shed in the field. Congratulations on joining the ranks of the world’s largest police force—this is a remarkable accomplishment!” Adityanath said, “The law is offering us continuous and clear direction for future reforms. Shifting from traditional methods of investigation and punishment to modern forensic technology and evidence is not only more effective for delivering justice but also helps prevent the misuse of justice. To support this approach, the State Institute of Forensic Sciences has been established in the state capital, Lucknow.” The CM lauded the appointment of 18 women as DSPs and said, “We had set a benchmark for having around 20 per cent women personnel in the police force. I am pleased that, following the selection process by the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission, 18 daughters of the state have become Deputy SPs. I extend my heartfelt congratulations to them and their families.

FAA reports flight delays at Newark airport due to radar outage,Unknown,2024-09-03 05:44:30+05:30,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said that delay of flights is expected overnight on Monday due to equipment outages at the Newark airport.

According to a NBC News report, incoming flights were affected on Monday as travelers started to return back home post the Labor Day weekend.

As per the FAA, the Newark Liberty International Airport witnessed flight delays on Monday starting at around 2:30 pm local time due to equipment outages, including Radar systems.

FAA equipment outages have caused #EWR Airport flight disruptions. Please check with your airline to determine the status of your flight. — Newark Liberty International Airport (@EWRairport) September 2, 2024

The airport, in an official statement on X stated, ""FAA equipment outages have caused #EWR Airport flight disruptions. Please check with your airline to determine the status of your flight.""

The FAA had confirmed later that the radar issue led to the delay of flights incoming to Newark airport and the slowing down of flights into New Jersey.

The radar issue is not only causing delay to the arrival of flights at Newark airport but the departure of several flights have also been affected.

Hi there. We are sorry to hear you have been effected by the airport radar outage at Newark. We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your continued patience. ^AL — United Airlines (@united) September 2, 2024

"Citing past conduct, Delhi High Court denies bail to man in cheating case",Sohini Ghosh,2024-09-03 05:37:23+05:30,"Rejecting the bail plea of a man who cheated people by making them believe that he was a representative of a government outfit, the Delhi High Court Monday reiterated that CrPC Section 436-A does not “confer upon an undertrial an absolute right to be enlarged on bail regardless of any other circumstance”.

CrPC Section 436-A prescribes that an undertrial is liable for bail if they have spent half the prescribed duration of punishment for the offences in prison.

Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani considered the past conduct of the accused, Rajendra Kumar Tripathi, where he failed to pay the complainant as was decided while granting him bail earlier, and failed to appear before the magistrate after being released on bail, “so much so that non-bailable warrants had to be issued against him and proceedings under Section 82 of CrPC initiated”. The court held that it is “not persuaded to grant to the petitioner the benefit of regular bail even under Section 436-A of the CrPC at this stage”.

Tripathi sought bail in the cheating case lodged against him at Daryaganj police station in 2017. A chargesheet was filed against him in 2019 under IPC sections 419 (cheating by personation) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) as well as under sections 3 and 5 of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act 1950.

The complainant in the case, Mukesh Gupta, had claimed he was cheated of Rs 37 lakh by Tripathi. He alleged that the accused posed as a chairman of an organisation, under the name and style of ‘National Housing Development Organisation’, which used to float fake tenders for government contracts and would later illegally appropriate the earnest money deposits made by the parties without awarding any contracts to them.

It was further alleged that Tripathi’s purported organisation represented itself as an outfit of the Government of India (GoI) by posting on its own website, and other internet platforms, photographs of the Prime Minister and the Union Urban Development Minister. This was done with the aim and intent of luring people into believing his organisation was a GoI undertaking or a public sector undertaking or a similar entity that was in a position to award high-value government contracts.

He was granted bail in the Daryaganj case by a magistrate court in 2019, subject to him fulfilling the conditions of a settlement with the complainant by paying the latter. But he had failed to comply with the settlement, arguing that his bank accounts were being frozen in a different case; the court then cancelled his bail.

Bombay HC slams Chembur Police for inaction in 90-year-old woman’s complaint against over Rs. 10 crore ‘fraud’,Omkar Gokhale,2024-09-03 05:20:28+05:30,"Expressing strong disapproval regarding the Chembur Police’s handling of a complaint from a 90-year-old woman, who is the victim of a financial fraud exceeding Rs 10 crore, the Bombay High Court Monday directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) to address her concerns about police inaction.

The court voiced concerns over the increasing number of fraud cases targeting the elderly, emphasizing, “Let her (petitioner) readily get justice and not when she is no more.”

The court questioned why charges of forgery under sections 467 and 468 of the IPC were not filed against the accused and demanded to know what steps the police had taken to apprehend the absconding co-accused.

A division bench of Justices Revati Mohite-Dere and Prithviraj K Chavan issued an order in response to the petition by Saroja Rajan, a nonagenarian from Chembur.

Rajan has requested that the investigation be transferred to the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) and be monitored by the court.

According to the petition, the accused, Bala Raman Krishnan, who previously lived in the same building as Rajan, conspired with his wife, Aslesha, to defraud her.

They took advantage of the fact that one of Rajan’s daughters had died and the other lived outside the city. Krishnan allegedly persuaded Rajan to open a separate demat account with Axis Securities and transferred over Rs 14 crore from her HDFC Securities account to Axis.

Krishnan further altered the email address and mobile number associated with the new demat account and Rajan’s primary savings bank account without her consent, making his wife the nominee for the Axis demat account. He allegedly transferred securities worth over Rs 8 crore to his account and nearly Rs 2 crore from her personal savings account.

Rajan discovered the unauthorised transactions when she requested a demat account statement to transfer shares to her elder daughter. She reported the fraud to the Chembur Police in April last year, and an FIR was registered in August 2023 for offenses under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC. Krishnan was arrested in June, this year and magistrate court rejected his bail plea last month.

Senior advocate Sanjog Parab, representing Rajan, argued that despite several representations, the police filed a chargesheet without including forgery charges.

The bench questioned DCP Hemraj Rajput about the lack of investigation into bank details, suggesting that the bank’s statements might be unreliable or that there could be collusion with the accused. “Why have your officers not collected the necessary bank details? Are you taking the bank’s statements at face value without consulting the petitioner? Even bank officers could be involved,” the bench queried.

The court further remarked, “Do senior citizens have to come to court because their complaints are not properly investigated? A senior citizen approaches you for help, and nothing is done. Justice should be promptly delivered, not delayed until it’s too late.”

The court criticised the probe as “not conducted in right earnest” and questioned why forgery charges and provisions of the Information Technology (IT) Act were not included, potentially affecting the possibility of bail for the accused.

After the DCP assured the court that he would address the concerns, the bench scheduled the matter for further hearings for September 11."
St. Stephen’s exceeded approved quota for Christian students: Delhi University,Cdata,2024-09-03 05:09:53+05:30,"St. Stephen's College principal acknowledged the mismatches identified by the university, the public notice said. (File photo)

Delhi University (DU) has accused St Stephen’s College of exceeding the approved quota for Christian candidates in its revised list of seat allocations in some programmes for the current academic session. The varsity further added that qualifying candidates, meeting the required criteria based on their Common University Entrance Test (CUET) scores, have not been able to secure seats in some programmes like BSc Honors.

The Indian Express had earlier reported that the college has not accepted applications of 12 students seeking admission to undergraduate courses under the ‘single girl child’ quota and around 10 students under the unreserved category. The supernumerary ‘single girl child’ quota, created by DU as a special provision, was implemented this year.

During an initial review of the list submitted by St Stephen’s College, DU identified “crucial and alarming aspects” that prevented the university from proceeding with the allocations. This was stated in a public notice related to the allocation of Christian candidates in Christian minority colleges under the Common Seat Allocation System (CSAS) Advertisement In the notice, DU also highlighted that in popular programmes, such as B.Sc (H) Chemistry and B.Sc (H) Physics, seats remain unfilled despite many prospective candidates with required CUET scores. St Stephen’s College Principal John Varghese did not respond to calls and messages from The Indian Express. According to the notification, the college had sent a programme-wise list of shortlisted candidates to DU on August 28 for admission purposes. However, during the initial validation of this list, DU said it discovered significant discrepancies that led it to seek clarification from the college. St. Stephen’s College principal acknowledged the mismatches identified by the university, the public notice said. Advertisement DU also mentioned that the original list provided by the college lacked specific details regarding the BA programme combinations, which hindered the university from making proper allocations. The revised list was received by the varsity on August 31, it was underlined, but issues persisted. In some BA programme combinations, no seats were allocated, while in others, the number of Christian candidates allocated exceeded the sanctioned quota. The university stated that it is currently conducting further validations of the latest lists sent by the college.

"A fresh coat of paint, proper classrooms, clean toilets: Gurgaon govt school with 8 students gets a makeover",Aiswarya Raj,2024-09-03 05:05:21+05:30,"A fresh coat of paint on the gate and the building, restoration of power connection, a mud flask carrying drinking water, a clean yard, three clean toilets reopened with water supply restored, and most importantly, a proper classroom for students — the Government Primary School Gopalpur Khera in Gurgaon has seen a major revamp in comparison to its derelict state less than two weeks ago.

The changes followed directions by Block Education Officer Sudesh Raghav to the officials concerned to address urgent issues after The Indian Express flagged infrastructural and manpower challenges at the school.

The school has just one teacher and eight students — children of migrant labourers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The teacher was earlier compelled to take classes in the verandah because there was no power connection at the school. The low turnout at the primary school has been attributed to the low population of the village in the DDO’s report.

Drawing and Disbursing officer Jal Singh said that the Block Education Officer asked him to furnish a report on the school’s condition following The Indian Express report on August 19.

Singh also said that the infrastructural facilities were adequate.

However, the Block Education Officer has asked him to arrange for another teacher from a school in the same cluster. “We are trying to improve the turnout to 20 students by the end of this month. A second teacher from the primary school in Garhi Harsaru will join by next Monday,” he said.

He added that they have sought a few desks and benches from the schools in the same cluster. “The funds allotted per school is Rs 7,500, which is not adequate and we have to pitch in every time a need arises,” Singh said.

He added that District Education Officer Indu Boken and District Elementary Education Officer Muni Ram in the district have scheduled visits to take note of the situation. More than 25 children studied in the school till March, the register shows.

A school is supposed to have at least 20 children, failing which the government’s rationalising exercise can lead to the merger of the school with another in the same cluster. However, the parents have voiced concerns, saying they can’t send their children too far.

Lalita Chawla, the guest teacher who has yet to be regularised despite her 18 years of service, said the school now has an official strength of six students, and two children who had been attending will soon be enrolled officially.

“We expect the strength to go up to 10 students by next week. We have painted the walls and written the name of the school so people know there is a school here. The sarpanch also visited to assure us that a patch will be cleared so the students have a playground,” she added.

Inside the classroom where the students sit, English alphabets are now painted on pink walls. A chart on “good habits” and sketches by the children can also be seen hanging.

In stark contrast to its condition two weeks back, two rooms have been thrown open — one doubles up as an office for the lone teacher and the staff while the second room is for students. The way to the toilets has also been cleared and cleaned.

A sewage line opening from the village to the school, triggering sanitation concerns, has also been removed, said the DDO mong other noticeable changes."
"CCS approves buying 240 aero engines from HAL for Rs 26,000 crore",Amrita Nayak Dutta,2024-09-03 05:00:46+05:30,"Last year, the IAF had floated an Expression of Interest for the repair and overhaul of 18 AL-31 FP aero engines for five years (File Photo/Representational)

The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) Monday approved a proposal to procure 240 aero-engines for the Su-30 MKI aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF) at a cost of over Rs 26,000 crore, the Defence Ministry said.

The engines (AL-31FP) will be procured under ‘Buy (Indian)’ category from Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), it said in a statement. The delivery of these aero-engines will start after a year and be completed over eight years.

The IAF has around 260 SU-30 MKI aircraft which form the backbone of its fighter fleet. The fourth-generation fighter jet is powered by two AL-31 FP aero engines. AL-31FP is a high-temperature turbojet by-pass engine of modular design. Advertisement As per the Defence Ministry, the supply of these aero-engines by HAL would meet the fleet sustenance requirement of IAF to continue their unhindered operations and strengthen the defence preparedness of the country. This means the existing engines of over 100 SU-30 MKIs reaching the end of their operational life will be replaced with the new engines.

The engines will have indigenous content over 54 per cent, enhanced due to indigenisation of some key components of aero-engines and will be manufactured at the Koraput division of HAL. Last year, the IAF had floated an Expression of Interest for the repair and overhaul of 18 AL-31 FP aero engines for five years. This year, HAL secured a contract to deliver over 100 Klimov RD-33 engines to power the MiG-29 upgraded fleet of the IAF.

"Behind shooting outside jewellery store in Northwest Delhi, four men with ‘links to gangsters’",Cdata,2024-09-03 04:51:25+05:30,"A former cyclist, a man who used to work as a driver, a teacher, and a Class XII dropout: These four men, brought together by their fascination with the criminal underworld, allegedly hatched a plan to target jewellery stores and demand extortion money.

Last month, they allegedly opened fire outside one such shop in Northwest Delhi’s Mukherjee Nagar and demanded protection money of Rs 1 crore from its owner. All four were arrested last week by the Delhi Police Special Cell.

Police suspect a gang angle behind the crime — the note demanding money, which the accused left the crime scene, purportedly mentioned names of gangsters Neeraj Bawana, Naveen Bali, Davinder Bambiha and Bhola.

The incident took place on August 24. Shots were fired outside Sehgal Jewellers, with a demand for protection money of Rs 1 crore. Police said CCTV footage of the showroom captured a man wearing a helmet. In another CCTV clip, the suspect and an associate were seen fleeing the spot on a white Apache motorcycle.

“Right after the incident, the shop owner also received a threatening phone call demanding the money,” the police said.

A case under the relevant sections was lodged and multiple teams were formed to crack the case; it was later transferred to the Special Cell given the involvement of gangster networks.

On August 28, the team zeroed in on the suspects and made their first arrests. One of the accused, Nikki Bidhuri, a resident of UP’s Bulandshahr, allegedly accompanied the shooter to the spot on the bike. The second, Hemant from Mathura, allegedly arranged the SIM card under a fake ID to make the extortion call.

“During questioning, the men said they, along with other gang members, conspired to fire gunshots in front of a jewellery shop to demand protection money,” said DCP (Special Cell) Manoj C.

The team then arrested the main shooter, Aakash alias Katil, a resident of Hapur, and co-accused Harender alias KD, a resident of Greater Noida. The two had gone underground, deactivating their mobile phones and social media accounts, following the arrests of Nikki and Hemant.

The DCP said, “The accused men meticulously planned the extortion. They first conducted a reconnaissance of prominent jewellery showrooms in Delhi-NCR. Once they picked their target, they stole a motorcycle and acquired a SIM card on a fake ID. On the day of the incident, Aakash and Nikki arrived on the stolen Apache to execute their plan. Nikki stood with the motorcycle in front of the showroom, while Aakash fired the shots. He then left behind a slip demanding protection money.”

Police said Aakash is a Class XII dropout. After leaving school, he got involved in petty crimes and was arrested in a robbery case in Delhi in 2021. “During his custody in Mandoli jail, he came in touch with several infamous gangsters. Following his release on bail, he followed these gangsters on social media and continued to be drawn into their criminal world. He, along with the other accused, devised a plan to extort money from affluent businessmen through extortion calls,” said the DCP.

Police said Nikki used to work as a driver at a school in Greater Noida. Two months ago, he quit his job and came in contact with Harender and Hemant. Nikki was facing financial hardships owing to losses in gambling so he joined hands with the men.

Harender, a resident of Greater Noida, holds an MA in Political Science and is a teacher. “Despite having a stable job, he harboured a deep fascination for the criminal underworld and this led to him being involved in the present case,” said police.

Hemant dropped out of his BSc course in the third year. Police said he claims to have participated in several cycling competitions. He fell into bad company and came in contact with infamous gangsters like Jaggu Bhagwanpuriya, Sampat Nehra and Vijay Mann, said police."
"Money laundering, hawala payments: What ED and CBI chargesheets say on Vijay Nair’s role in excise case",Nirbhay Thakur,2024-09-03 04:47:43+05:30,"After two years in jail, Vijay Nair, AAP’s communication in-charge at the time of his arrest, was granted bail Monday by the Supreme Court in a money laundering case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the excise policy case. Among all the accused in the case, he spent the maximum time in jail.

While granting Nair bail, the bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy and S V N Bhatti underlined that “the universal proposition of bail being the rule and jail being the exception will be entirely defeated if he is kept in custody as an undertrial for such a long duration for an offence punishable with a maximum of seven years sentence”. It was further noted by the bench that the right to liberty under Article 21 is “sacrosanct” and “needs to be respected” even in cases where stringent provisions are enacted.

The case against Nair

Nair was accused of being a middleman between the ‘South Group’ — which allegedly gave Rs 100 crore as kickbacks to enter the liquor retail segment in Delhi — and AAP. The ED also accused him of money laundering as the agency alleged kickbacks were received during AAP’s 2022 Goa Assembly poll campaign.

The ED had claimed the kickback was allegedly facilitated by co-accused Abhishek Boinpally, currently out on interim bail, in connivance with Nair and his associate, Dinesh Arora (now an approver). An amount of Rs 30 crore was allegedly handled by Arora and Boinpally under Nair’s instructions, as per the agency.

Referring to two statements made by Indospirit owner Sameer Mahendru, also a co-accused in the case, in November 2022, the agency claimed Nair told Mahendru that “the new excise policy was the brainchild of (CM) Arvind Kejriwal”. “…Vijay fixed a meeting with him twice but that could not materialise. So Vijay made Sameer speak to Kejriwal on a Facetime call,” the ED stated, citing Mahendru’s statement.

Kejriwal allegedly told Mahendru on the purported video call that “Vijay is his boy and that Sameer should trust him”. The ED alleged “this incident assured Mahendru of Nair’s credibility and clout” and “reveals support Nair was given by the top leaders of AAP including the head of the party and the Delhi Govt, Arvind Kejriwal”.

On the other hand, the CBI, which is also investigating the excise policy, stated in its chargesheet that hawala channel transactions amounting to Rs 20-30 crore were allegedly made by South-Indian based liquor manufacturers to Nair in order to use his position in the ruling party in Delhi to achieve the illegal objective of cartelisation.

The CBI further alleged that Nair, in collusion with co-accused Dinesh and Amit Arora, “arm-twisted” a few wholesalers to surrender their L-1 licences and coerced manufacturers to choose wholesalers of his choice.

Nair’s rebuttal

Senior advocate A M Singhvi, representing Nair, highlighted the long period spent by the accused in custody (672 days). He also pointed out that former Deputy CM Manish Sisodia was granted bail by the apex court on the grounds of delay in trial and that this would apply to Nair as well.

Singhvi also said all those who were called masterminds by the ED had already been granted bail. He also pointed out that ED had termed Nair an “important player” and not a “mastermind” in the case."
Delhi to Ratlam: Flicker of hope for lives razed as SC questions bulldozer justice,Upasika Singhal,2024-09-03 04:45:10+05:30,"From a juice shop owner in Delhi to a tempo driver in Rajasthan to a loader in Madhya Pradesh — it was the demolition of several properties that came up before the Supreme Court, which on Monday said it would lay down “pan-India” guidelines on demolition of houses linked to people accused of crimes.

The first of these pleas was filed by the Jamiat-Ulama-i-Hind on April 20, 2022, in the midst of a demolition drive following communal violence in Delhi’s Jahangirpuri.

While the violence was witnessed on April 16, state BJP president wrote a letter to the North Delhi Municipal Corporation three days later, seeking demolition of properties of alleged rioters. The next day, the NDMC launched a demolition drive to remove “illegal encroachments”.

On April 24, another petition was filed by former Rajya Sabha MP and CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat challenging the demolition drive.

One of the structures partially demolished in the drive was Ganesh Gupta’s juice shop, located at a junction next to Kushal Cinema in Jahangirpuri.

“It has taken a lot of hard work to get this shop up and running again,” 56-year-old Gupta told The Indian Express.

On the day of the demolitions, the Supreme Court had stayed the demolition drive, but the NDMC went ahead with it, Gupta said. “They told us that until they received a hard copy of the order, they wouldn’t stop,” he said.

Gupta recalled hearing about the impending demolitions on the news and running to his shop with the building’s documents. “I kept shouting that I have all the papers, but no one listened,” he said. He also claimed that he had not received any notice from the NDMC.

The shop had been allotted by Delhi Development Authority to Gupta’s father in 1977. He now runs it with his son, Rajan (32).

After the demolition, the shop remained closed for six months as Gupta tried to arrange the money to rebuild it. “I took a loan and borrowed money from relatives… The biggest problem was that my daughter was to get married in November. We had to borrow money from her in-laws, too. In total, I would have borrowed at least Rs 12-15 lakh. I’ll have to repay this debt for the rest of my life,” said Gupta.

He said he suffered a heart attack days after the demolition, and another one six months later, just before his shop reopened.

Gupta welcomed the Supreme Court’s observation on Monday. “Even if I was involved in the riots, how could they demolish my shop until I’m proven guilty? I pay tax, MCD’s licence fee, DDA’s lease… How could they come here and say my shop was unauthorised?” he asked.

‘Nobody listened’

Also among petitioners who approached the Supreme Court against “bulldozer justice” is a labourer from Madhya Pradesh’s Ratlam district, whose home was partially demolished after his son was arrested for allegedly slaughtering a cow and dumping its carcass at a temple in June this year.

“Our family built the home in 50 years, and the bulldozers demolished it in four hours. We welcome the Supreme Court observations and hope they protect the common citizens of this country. I paid taxes and electricity bills. I had court orders in my favour regarding the house, but nobody listened to us,” 54-year-old Hussain told The Indian Express.

Hussain works as a loader, earning around Rs 5,000-7,000 per month. His family comprises seven members.

The property that was demolished was located at Jaora in Ratlam, and comprised a house and a shop. Hussain’s grandfather Noor Mohammad had purchased the property in 1990 and eventually divided it amongst his five sons, he said.

The incident that eventually led to the demolition took place on June 13-14, and prompted several outfits to orchestrate a shutdown of Jaora and blockade a four-lane road.

Police initially arrested two persons – Sharukh and Noshad Qureshi – in the case, and imposed provisions of the National Security Act on them.

Later, a police team reached Hussain’s house asking about his son, Salman Mevati. The son was asked to go to the police station and eventually arrested.

Hussain said a large crowd had gathered outside the police station demanding that his house be demolished. He recalled that he had grabbed all the relevant documents “to show ownership”, but “the authorities paid no heed”, and demolished around 10 feet of the property.

His family then had to move out. “Our family could not get any home on rent as we were ostracised. My sons were fired from their jobs. We stayed at a relative’s home,” he said.

‘Courts are last resort’

Another man who petitioned the Supreme Court after his house was demolished was Rashid Khan. He owned the Udaipur house that was rented by the family of a school student, who allegedly stabbed his schoolmate to death.

The incident, which took place on August 16, triggered communal tensions in the city.

On the morning of August 17, the Udaipur Municipal Corporation and the Forest Department pasted a notice on the house that was rented by the family of the accused boy. By 11 am, the house was demolished.

The landlord and homeowner, Rashid Khan, who drives a tempo, told The Indian Express, “I bought the property in 2019 for Rs 16.5 lakh, but the government demolished it without listening to me. The accused person and his family were tenants in the house. I have no role in this incident. I just want justice from the courts as they are the last resort.”

Asked if the property was built on forest land as claimed by the authorities, he said the whole Diwan Shah Colony in Udaipur was built on forest land, and asked why only his house was demolished.

The Association for the Protection of Civil Rights helped Rashid file the court case.

Muzzammil Rizvi, general secretary of APCR, said, “We are in support of punishing the accused if he is at fault, but punishing an innocent man who was not involved in any way with the incident is not justified. Even the family of the accused has nowhere to live now. What kind of justice is this? We have approached the court and we hope justice will be given to Rashid Khan.”"
"Due diligence required of exchanges, merchant bankers on SME IPOs is missing: Sebi Whole Time Member",Hitesh Vyas,2024-09-03 04:42:26+05:30,"Amid concerns over manipulations in initial public offerings (IPOs) of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi) Whole Time Member Ashwani Bhatia on Monday said that due diligence required of stock exchanges and merchant bankers for such IPOs is possibly missing.

His statement comes as listing of SMEs on NSE and BSE have been witnessing irrational exuberance with a number of these IPOs getting oversubscribed by 500 and 700 times.

“We should learn to say no. Perhaps this is one thing that has not been done. Very often and what we have seen in the recent past is the fact that the checks and balances are simply not there. Nobody is actually saying ‘no’ to the (SME) applicants,” Bhatia said at the CII Financing 3.0 summit.

“Maybe the diligence that is required of the chartered accountants (CAs), merchant bankers and exchanges, is possibly missing and they need to do some hard work over there,” he said.

Drawing an analogy of doctors prescribing medicine to patients, Bhatia said, “Leave good doctors to these (SMEs) companies. Don’t give them steroids when they can survive on paracetamol.”

“If you try to take shortcuts and inflate balance sheets, I think the relationships between the intermediaries and companies will be a very short one,” Bhatia warned.

Last week, Sebi said that it has noticed that, post listing, some of the SME companies and their promoters have been resorting to certain means that project an unrealistic picture of their operations.

Advertisement

Such companies or promoters have been seen to make public announcements that create a positive picture of their operations. These announcements are typically followed up with various corporate actions such as bonus issues, stock splits, preferential allotments, etc.

“The above actions create a positive sentiment amongst investors, which induces them into purchasing such securities. Simultaneously, this also presents an easy opportunity to the promoters to off-load their holdings in such companies at elevated prices,” Sebi had said.

Bhatia further said that the SME platforms of stock exchanges, which got operationalised in 2012, have been serving as an alternate source of raising funds for emerging businesses.

Ever since there has been an increase in the number of SME issues and investor participation.

During the last decade, more than Rs 14,000 crore has been raised from this platform, of which around Rs 6,000 crore was raised during FY2024.

In recent years, listing on the SME platform has seen increased traction. Annual listings on SME platforms through IPOs have increased four-fold over the last five years from 46 in 2019-20 to 196 in FY2024. The amount of funds raised through IPOs has increased 12-fold over five years from Rs 495 crore to Rs 6,096 crore. The market capitalisation of SME companies has grown to Rs 2 lakh crore at present, he said."
Investors sell 54% of shares allotted in IPO in a week from listing: Sebi study,Cdata,2024-09-03 04:41:09+05:30,"Indicating the “flipping behaviour” of investors, about 54 per cent of IPO (initial public offering) shares (in value terms) allotted to investors (excluding anchor investors) were sold within a week from listing, according to Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) study.

Individual investors sold 50.2 per cent shares (in value terms) allotted to them within a week from listing, the regulator said. Non-institutional investors (NIIs) sold 63.3 per cent shares by value while retail investors sold 42.7 per cent shares by value, the study said.

“Mutual Funds tend to invest for longer period in IPO shares, whereas banks tend to sell swiftly. Mutual Funds sold about 3.3 per cent of allotted value within a week, as compared to 79.8 per cent for banks,” Sebi said. Investors, in general, show “disposition effect”, implying greater propensity to exit from the IPOs that exhibit positive listing gain than those that exhibit loss on listing.

“Individual investors sold 67.6 per cent shares by value allotted to them within a week, when returns were more than 20 per cent and sold 23.3 per cent shares by value, when returns were negative,” it said. 39.3 per cent of retail investors were from Gujarat, followed by Maharashtra (13.5 per cent) and Rajasthan (10.5 per cent).

“Almost half of the total allotted demat accounts that applied for IPOs during April 2021- December 2023, were opened in the post-COVID period (during 2021-2023).

The Sebi conducted the study in the wake of the increasing participation of retail investors and the heightened oversubscription in recent IPOs. The study encompasses data from 144 IPOs listed between April 2021 and December 2023, it said.

“Following Sebi’s policy interventions regarding non-institutional investor (NII) share allotment process and RBI’s guidelines on IPO financing by NBFCs in April 2022, there was a significant reduction in NII category oversubscription. Oversubscription under the NII category halved from 38 times to 17 times.

The average number of applications from NII investors applying for more than Rs 1 crore in IPOs dropped from approximately 626 per IPO in the pre-policy period (April 2021 — March 2022) to around 20 per IPO in the post-policy period (April 2022 — December 2023).

The activity in the IPO market remained buoyant during FY22 to FY24, on back of stronger retail participation as reflected by number of applications and oversubscription. “Success of the IPOs was partly supported by overall positive market sentiments and was further boosted by strong post-listing performance in some of the IPOs,” the study said.

Of the 144 IPOs listed during April 2021- December 2023, 75 per cent IPOs (108 in number) delivered positive returns. As many as 26 IPOs delivered more than 50 per cent listing day returns. Although, there were some laggards post-listing, it did not deterred enthusiasm in new IPOs. As many as 92 IPOs were oversubscribed more than 10 times and only 2 IPOs were undersubscribed, Sebi said."

Excise policy case: Who are the accused that remain behind bars?,Nirbhay Thakur,2024-09-03 04:36:05+05:30,"In the last 25 days, three key persons arrested in relation to the Delhi excise policy cases were granted bail by the Supreme Court — former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia; Vijay Nair, who was AAP’s communication in-charge at the time of his arrest; and Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) legislator K Kavitha.

Out of the 40 accused persons in both the money laundering case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the corruption cases filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), five still remain in judicial custody.

Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi Chief Minister

As per the agencies, Kejriwal allegedly received “bribe money” from the ‘South Group’ (business persons from South India) in exchange for granting favours to them when the now-scrapped excise policy was being drafted.

The CBI also alleged he ensured that Rs 90 lakh from “bribe money” would be given to each of the 40 AAP candidates during the 2022 Goa Assembly polls.

Kejriwal was arrested by the ED on March 21. On June 26, he was formally arrested by the CBI. He was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court in the ED’s money laundering case on July 12 but remains in judicial custody in the CBI’s corruption case.

His bail plea, along with a plea challenging his arrest by the CBI, will be heard in the SC on September 5.

Vinod Chauhan, alleged hawala operator

Chauhan was allegedly involved in the transfer of Rs 25.5 crore to fund the AAP’s 2022 Goa Assembly poll campaign, as per the ED.

The agency also alleged that Rs 1.06 crore was seized from his house. Chauhan was unable to disclose the source of the amount, the ED had said.

Arrested by the ED, he has been in custody since May. Currently, his bail plea is being heard in Rouse Avenue Court.

Amandeep Dhall, director of Brindco Sales Pvt Ltd

As per the CBI, Dhall, a businessman, allegedly conspired with co-accused Vijay Nair and played an instrumental role in facilitating and arranging meetings with members of the ‘South Group’, and was involved in the recoupment of bribes/kickbacks by issuing additional credit notes.

In June 2024, the Delhi High Court denied him bail, stating that documents indicated he played a “key role” in formulating and manipulating the excise policy to secure undue financial benefits.

He was arrested by the CBI on April 18, 2023. He has been in custody for around 18 months.

Arun Ramachandra Pillai, Hyderabad-based businessman

Pillai was allegedly part of the ‘South Group’ that sent ‘kickbacks’ worth Rs 100 crore to AAP leaders. As per the ED, Pillai had 32.5% shares in Indospirit, a liquor manufacturing group.

As per the ED, out of the Rs 68 crore profit that Indospirit allegedly earned through cartelisation, Rs 29 crore was transferred to Pillai’s accounts.

He was arrested by the ED on March 6, 2023.

The Delhi High Court in June this year denied interim bail (moved on medical grounds) to Pillai, after noting that his medical reports did not indicate he was “suffering from any life-threatening ailment”.

Sameer Mahendru, managing director of M/s Indospirit Group

As per the ED, Mahendru allegedly had a 35% partnership stake in Indospirit LLP, which got a wholesale L1 licence. He also obtained two retail zone licences under the name of Khao Gali restaurants which are under the name of his father-in-law “but (he) used to take all financial decisions in Khao Gali” and was the beneficial owner of the company, it is alleged.

Mahendru was arrested by the ED in September 2022. He was granted interim bail for 43 days in January this year by Special Judge M K Nagpal of Rouse Avenue Court.

His bail plea is pending in the Delhi High Court."
Five people shot at New York’s West Indian American Day parade: Police,Unknown,2024-09-03 04:35:03+05:30,"A targeted shooting occurred during the West Indian American Day Parade in Brooklyn, New York City, on Monday, injuring five people.

NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell stated that the attack was intentional, with the gunman specifically targeting a group of individuals, rather than a random act of violence.

The suspect fled the scene after the shooting, which took place around 2:35 p.m. along the parade route. This incident is the latest in a concerning trend of violence at the parade, a major annual celebration of Caribbean culture, as reported by AP.

The parade, which had commenced hours earlier, saw thousands of participants dancing and marching along Eastern Parkway, one of Brooklyn's main thoroughfares. Despite the shooting, the festivities were expected to continue into the night.

Of the five victims, two were critically injured, while the other three are expected to survive, according to Chell.

An Associated Press videographer on the scene witnessed at least two individuals being treated for injuries to the face and arm.

The West Indian American Day Parade continued uninterrupted despite the shooting incident that injured five people, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer completing the route. Police secured the area near the shooting, gathering evidence as the parade proceeded.

Chief of Patrol John Chell urged witnesses to share any video footage, stressing the importance of community assistance in solving the case.

The 57th annual parade is a testament to the Caribbean community's vibrancy, featuring elaborate costumes, feathered attire, and colorful flags, demonstrating the power of culture and resilience in the face of adversity.

The event is a major attraction, drawing large crowds along the nearly two-mile route from Crown Heights to the Brooklyn Museum.

It also holds significant importance for local politicians, many of whom have West Indian heritage or represent the city's substantial Caribbean community.

However, the parade has been marred by violence over the years. In 2016, two people were killed, and several others wounded near the parade route.

The previous year, Carey Gabay, an aide to then-Governor Andrew Cuomo, was fatally shot during pre-parade festivities.

The West Indian American Day Parade has its origins in early 20th-century pre-Lenten Carnival celebrations initiated by a Trinidadian immigrant in Manhattan. In the 1940s, the festivities were moved to the warmer Labor Day weekend.

Brooklyn, home to a significant Caribbean population, has hosted the parade since the 1960s. Today, the parade is the culmination of several days of carnival events in the city, including a steel pan band competition and J’Ouvert, a separate street party celebrating emancipation from slavery.

"Amanatullah Khan arrest: BJP, Congress take aim at AAP",Cdata,2024-09-03 04:29:29+05:30,"The BJP and Congress Monday targeted the AAP over the arrest of its Okhla MLA Amanatullah Khan for his alleged role in illegal recruitments and alleged financial irregularities in the Delhi Waqf Board.

Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva asked the party to “introspect” following Khan’s arrest alleging that the party was full of “criminals and corrupt individuals” and that the law would take its course against them.

“In India, the rule of law prevails, and whenever you loot, steal, or indulge in corruption, you will have to answer for it. Investigative agencies are doing their job… if the agency is doing its job, why are AAP leaders so anxious? If you are right, the truth will come out,” he said.

“AAP has a long list of criminals and corrupt individuals, and whenever action is taken against them, they start making noise. Today, that drama has unfolded before everyone,” he added.

Delhi Congress president Devender Yadav said Khan’s arrest was yet another example of the “deep-rooted corruption and cheating” prevalent in the AAP government which had “broken all records in corruption.”

“The AAP, which came to power swearing honesty and transparency, has proved to be the most corrupt, commission-driven political party, and the arrest of Khan is yet another example of the malaise afflicting the government,” Yadav alleged.

“Khan is perhaps the 19th AAP MLA to come under the scanner of probe agencies for corruption… Delhi Congress had complained to the L-G nearly three years ago about Khan’s corruption in the Delhi Waqf Board, following which the probe agencies were put on his trail. The ED arrest is a culmination of that,” he added."
"‘Wounded Hindu sentiments, created divide’: FIR into arrest of Assam singer",Sukrita Baruah,2024-09-03 04:28:36+05:30,"Assam’s Bengali-Muslim singer Altap Hussain, who was arrested over a controversial protest song, was trying to whip up a “dispute between the Hindu and Miya communities”, the FIR registered in the case states.

Altap, a 35-year-old singer from Dhubri, was arrested Saturday for protest song called ‘Asom tumar baapor neki, khaali miya khedibo khuja (Does Assam belong to your father that you just want to chase Miyas out)’, sung in Assamese. “Miya” is a pejorative term for Bengali Muslims.

The arrest followed a suo motu FIR registered on August 30 under Section 299 (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). The singer has been remanded in police custody.

Released last week following recent tensions in the state and widely circulated online, the video of the song features Altap dancing with movements similar to Assam’s folk dance, Bihu.

The complaint, filed by the officer-in-charge of the Gauripur police station and which forms the basis of the FIR, points to one particular line.

“His song, by saying that that pujaris in mandirs commit rapes, wounded the religious sentiments of all Hindu people and along with that has created divide and clash between East Bengali Muslims (Miya) and indigenous tribals,” the complaint states.

The song also refers to the tensions in the state following the alleged gangrape of a 14-year girl in Nagaon district on August 22.

Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma referred to Altap’s arrest during the course of one of his regular Facebook live sessions on Sunday. He referred to the song as part of an “attack” and called it an attempt to “change Bihu into Miya Bihu”.

“Attacking and abusing us, and critiquing our civilisation culture, some have started Miya Bihu as well. This man called Altap Hussain singing Miya Bihu has been arrested by the police today. I want to say one thing clearly: that as long as we are around, till the time that our society is alive, we will continue living with self-respect. We will not accept an attack on our social order,” he said.

Days after this song was released, Altap came out with another protest song, which goes: “We are Assamese citizens of India. Why do you keep saying Miya, Miya. It really hurts.”

Altap’s younger brother Anwar told The Indian Express that the family did not know about the song until his brother’s arrest.

“We know that he sings and makes music, and that he puts them up on YouTube. He has been singing ever since he was small and had learnt by himself. But we don’t know about the kind of music he makes. We don’t know anything. I only came to know about this song after he was arrested,” he said."
"If I utter the word REITs, I will be accused of conflict of interest: Sebi Chairperson Buch",Hitesh Vyas,2024-09-03 04:26:52+05:30,"Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi) Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch on Monday said that even if she were to utter the word real estate investment trust (REIT), she would be “accused of a conflict of interest”.

Her statement comes in the response to the US-based Hindenburg Research, last month’s allegations that since Buch became Chairperson in March 2022, Sebi “has proposed and implemented a raft of REIT legislation, of significant benefit to Blackstone as one of the largest REIT sponsors in India, whom her husband, Dhaval Buch, works for”.

“… If I utter the word REITs, I am accused of a conflict of interest. So perhaps it would be better for me to abstain,” Buch said while referring to a slide of her presentation during her speech at the CII Financing 3.0 summit on Monday.

This was the second public appearance of Buch since Hindenburg Research’s allegations in August. Later, when asked about Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera’s allegations against her of drawing salary while being the on the board of Sebi, Buch did not respond. Khera has claimed that the Sebi Chairperson continued to draw salary from ICICI since 2017, when she joined Sebi as a whole-time member (WTM), and then took over at the helm of the market regulator.

Hindenburg had claimed that during Dhaval Buch’s time as an advisor to Blackstone, Sebi came out with 7 consultation papers on REIT, 3 consolidated updates, 2 new regulatory frameworks and nomination rights for units, specifically benefiting private equity firms like Blackstone.

“During Dhaval Buch’s time as senior advisor, while his wife was a Sebi official, Blackstone sponsored Mindspace and Nexus Select Trust, India’s second and fourth REIT to receive Sebi approval to publicly IPO,” the US-based short-seller had said.

Buch and her husband have denied these allegations and said that over the last two years, Sebi has issued more than 300 circulars (including “Ease of Doing Business” initiatives in line with the developmental mandate of Sebi) across the entire market eco-system.

“All regulations of Sebi are approved by its Board (and not by its Chairperson) after extensive public consultation. Insinuations that a handful of these matters related to the REIT industry were favours to any specific party are malicious and motivated,” Sebi Chairperson and her husband had said in a joint statement last month.

Hindenburg had alleged that Blackstone has been one of the largest investors and sponsors of REITs, a nascent asset class in India. India’s first ever REIT, Embassy, obtained Sebi approval and launched an IPO on April 1, 2019, sponsored by Blackstone, just 3 months before Dhaval Buch reported joining Blackstone in July 2019. Nearly 13 months later, in August 2020, Mindspace REIT, backed by Blackstone, became India’s second REIT to IPO, after SEBI approval.

“Blackstone now sponsors Nexus Select Trust, described as India’s largest retail platform of assets, by ICICI Research, which listed in May, 2023 and became India’s fourth publicly traded REIT. Blackstone has multiple other interests across retail estate,” Hindenburg had said.

A REIT raises funds by issuing units to investors and invests those funds primarily in assets in the real estate sector. The investment in such assets can be made directly or through a special purpose vehicle (SPV)/holding Company. The investors who hold units in a REIT are called unit holders. The income generated from the underlying assets of the REIT are regularly distributed to the unit holders.

At the CII event, the Sebi Chairperson said soon the country will have a systematic investment plan (SIP) instalment amount starting at Rs 250 per month. Currently, the minimum SIP instalment amount is Rs 500 per month.

“We are well on our way to making a Rs 250 (per month) SIP a reality in our country,” she said.

Sebi has been working very closely with the mutual fund industry to make the smaller amount of SIP viable and get traction, Buch said."
"Sebi Chairperson ‘corrupt’: Zee’s Subhash Chandra; ‘baseless’ allegations, says Sebi official",Cdata,2024-09-03 04:25:11+05:30,"Hours after the Congress party made allegations against Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi) Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch, Zee group founder Subhash Chandra on Monday alleged that Buch is “corrupt” and her income should be investigated by investigating agencies.

“I am convinced that Sebi Chairperson is corrupt since she and her husband whose combined income was around Rs one crore per annum, before she assumed the position at Sebi, has now gone up to Rs 40-50 crore per annum,” Chandra alleged in a press statement.

This needs to be investigated by media and investigating agencies, including analysis of the settled/compounded cases and the consultation fees paid by such corporates and received by Sebi Chairperson and her connected persons, he alleged.

However, rejecting Chandra’s allegations outright, a Sebi official said, “these are opportunistic comments and completely baseless.”

The market regulator is investigating an alleged fund diversion by Chandra and his son Punit Goenka who is also the MD and CEO of Zee Entertainment Enterprises. In a confirmatory order in August 2023, Sebi barred both of them from holding key positions in four group firms. A Sebi investigation had found that around Rs 2,000 crore alleged fund diversion happened in Zee Entertainment.

Chandra’s comments on Buch came on a day when Congress party alleged Buch of “holding an Office of Profit at ICICI Bank”, and receiving an income to the tune of Rs 16.80 crore between 2017 and 2024 after she took over as the Whole Time Member of Sebi in 2017. However, ICICI Bank said that the bank or its group companies have “not paid any salary or granted any ESOPs” to Buch after her retirement, other than her retiral benefits.

Chandra alleged that he was approached by a person named Manjit Singh on February 17 2024. Singh promised that the work will be done through Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband and all issues of Sebi will be resolved for a price, Chandra alleged.

“However, on looking at the latest Hindenburg and ICICI Bank revelations against Madhabi Puri Buch and her connected persons, it seems that the person who approached me may have been right. May be this was the modus operandi in various cases, which have got settled/adjudicated through compounding with light touch,” he said.

Chandra alleged that former ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar paid hefty sums of money to Buch when she was the Whole Time Member of the Sebi, “It was Chanda Kochhar and her husband; and Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband working in tandem, hence Madhabi Puri Buch was paid hefty sums of money by ICICI while she was the Whole Time Member at Sebi,” Chandra alleged.

The Zee patriarch further alleged that “Sebi has not been acting in the interest of investors of ZEE Entertainment”. “ZEE-Sony merger was progressing well and they had got Sebi/ stock exchange approval. Despite the same, Sebi instructed BSE/ NSE to intervene in NCLT proceedings and scuttle the merger by spooking Sony. Ultimately the merger was terminated by Sony which resulted in erosion of huge wealth of minority shareholders,” Chandra alleged.

“I have taken a decision not to co-operate with Sebi any further in my personal capacity,” Chandra said."
"AAP’s Vijay Nair, Bibhav Kumar granted bail: Delhi Assembly polls next year, duo to play key role in party affairs",Mallica Joshi,2024-09-03 04:24:44+05:30,"Till a few months ago, with its top leadership in jail, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was facing its worst crisis since its formation in 2012.

With the Supreme Court granting bail to Vijay Nair, who was AAP’s communication in-charge at the time of his arrest, and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s aide Bibhav Kumar on Monday — nearly a month after former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia walked out of jail — the party now finds itself in a vastly different position.

For AAP, more than the actual bail orders, it is the timing that is crucial. “We knew that sooner or later, both would get bail but it happening at this crucial juncture, when the party has kicked off its Assembly election campaign and key internal MCD elections are to be held, is the highlight. We are hopeful that the chief minister will also get bail now,” a senior party leader said.

The hearing on Kejriwal’s bail plea — he is in custody in the Delhi excise policy case — is scheduled on Thursday.

Nair, who was arrested by the CBI and then by the ED in the excise policy case, was “likely to resume his previous role” after walking out of jail on Tuesday, party insiders said.

“Vijay, over and above his responsibilities as AAP’s communications in-charge, was as much a target of the conspiracy against its leadership as anyone who was arrested (in the excise policy case). He is likely to resume his previous role after spending 24 months in prison — he was arrested on September 27, 2022 — but after he likely takes some time off to be with his family,” a party leader said.

Nair’s association with the AAP began in 2014-15, where he worked mostly on social media strategy, party events, and fundraising. It was in 2019 that the shift came about, where he was managing the campaign, messaging, and optics from start to finish.

After AAP’s win in the 2020 Assembly polls, his role expanded and he advised the party on not just communication but also politics, campaigning, manifesto, and policy matters.

With elections in Delhi expected in the next 4-5 months, the role Nair now assumes will be significant as the AAP faces 10 years of anti-incumbency.

Meanwhile, Bibhav Kumar — accused of assaulting AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal at the CM’s residence on May 13 — cannot return as Kejriwal’s private secretary (PS) or visit the CM’s home, as per court orders, but will be donning his previous role in the party as well.

“Bibhav ji, one of the founding members of the AAP and much more to the party than just his (Kejriwal’s) PS, will be back in the same role as far as the internal administration of the party and the interface of its leadership with other elected members are concerned,” the leader added.

According to party sources, Kumar has always had a direct line with MLAs as well as councillors and has communicated their concerns to the party leadership. “At a time when we are headed into the ward committee elections in MCD and the assembly elections, the party needs his deft hand,” a party leader added."

"Supreme Court questions bulldozer justice, will lay down ‘pan-India’ norms for due process",Ananthakrishnan G,2024-09-03 04:20:25+05:30,"Pointing to concerns over bulldozers being used to demolish the houses of people accused of some crime in some states, the Supreme Court on Monday said it would lay down “pan-India” guidelines on the issue.

“It is a position of law. How can anybody’s house be demolished only because he is an accused? Even if he is a convict, it can’t be done without following the procedure as prescribed by law,” remarked Justice B R Gavai.

“We propose to lay down certain guidelines on a pan-India basis so that the concerns with regard to the issues raised are taken care of,” said the bench, which included Justice K V Viswanathan. The bench also invited suggestions from the concerned parties for the proposed guidelines.

The bench, however, made it clear that it would not protect unauthorised constructions. “Every municipal law has a provision for demolition of unauthorised construction… we are not going to protect any unauthorised construction or encroachment on public roads, not even the temples on the public road,” said Justice Gavai.

The court was hearing a plea against the demolition drive in Delhi’s Jahangirpuri area soon after the 2022 riots. The petitioners pointed out that many state governments were increasingly resorting to the use of bulldozers to demolish properties of people accused in crimes.

Appearing for the Uttar Pradesh government, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said all demolitions carried out in the state strictly followed procedure, but the petitioners were trying to project it in a different way.

He referred to an affidavit filed by the state on August 9, 2022, which said: “Merely because a person is alleged to have been a part of some offence can never be a ground based upon which his immovable property can be demolished. The demolition of an immovable property can take place only for violation of, and in accordance with, the procedure prescribed in the respective, applicable municipal law or law governing development authorities of the area. In other words, no immovable property can be demolished solely on the ground that the owner or occupant of such property is involved in a criminal offence. Demolition, whether in part on full, can take place only on the grounds mentioned in the municipal law, governing legal construction, and after following the procedure therein”.

Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the petitioners, then said: “Let a statement be recorded that bulldozer justice will not be meted out to people. Every state is now indulging in this”.

“You are accepting this position (as stated in the affidavit),” the bench asked the SG, to which Mehta responded in the affirmative. “We will record and issue guidelines to all the states,” the bench then said.

Agreeing, Mehta said other states could also file their affidavits.

Taking note of the SG’s submission, Justice Viswanathan said: “Why can’t some guidelines… not be laid down? Notice, time period, response, reply, order, time for legal remedy, avoid backdating, some communication with central secretariat, the nodal agency, automated reply so that there is no fear. And in taking off from what you have fairly and in a non-adversarial manner said, so that it’s put in position across the states, and directions issued.”

Justice Gavai then remarked that the court would not protect any unauthorised constructions, “not even temples on public road”.

Interjecting, Mehta said, “any religious place on public road”.

“What you have said… is very correct, (it) has to operate in practice. And that will only operate in practice if something is streamlined,” Justice Viswanathan told the SG.

“Though this is the position of law, it is seen that it is followed more in breach,” Justice Gavai said.

Denying this, Mehta said he could show that in each case of demolition, the rules were followed. “They have projected it as if somebody committed an offence and his house was demolished. But we have been able to show from affidavits that he was independently issued notice long back, notice was repeated, since he did not appear etc etc, (subsequent actions were carried out),” he said.

“Don’t get into the facts. We just have some guidelines so that tomorrow there is no bulldozer… And so that it is documented and checked, so that neither of them can take advantage — people who are having unauthorised constructions, nor the authorities,” Justice Viswanathan told the SG.

Responding to this, Mehta said only “bulldozer not in accordance with law” should not happen. “Suppose I am already facing a notice, I would also know my construction is unauthorised. Then, merely because I have taken part in some crime, it would not absolve me of the inevitable consequences of demolition,” he said.

“If the construction is unauthorised as per municipal law… Suppose it’s in the margin in the area, if somebody is required to give 10 feet margin in the front and 5 feet on each side… but then even such construction has to be demolished in accordance with the law,” Justice Gavai said.

“Certainly. Your lordships have very rightly and very pertinently (said) even after conviction it cannot be done,” the SG said.

“As they say, a pious father can have a recalcitrant son and vice versa, but this is no way to go about it,” remarked Justice Viswanathan.

Mehta, however, maintained: “It is not the way it is projected. From past instances also, I can show that notices were issued. They happened to be involved in some crime. Otherwise, the entire procedure was followed”.

Dave said the Delhi demolition drive was initiated after the VHP and Bajrang Dal were denied police permission to carry out a procession. “Is this the unauthorised construction,” he asked.

“That is why if you pin the authorities — who, according to you, are acting in breach — to a documentation procedure which will be impregnable, including digital proof… we can ensure… that is the immediate requirement now. So if you can give suggestions… we will fine-tune it,” Justice Viswanathan said.

Mehta said “some third party Jamiat”, which was not affected personally, had approached the court while those whose illegal constructions had been demolished had not done so as they knew that the procedure was followed.

Senior Advocate C U Singh, meanwhile, said he was filing applications on behalf of some people who were affected by the demolitions.

The bench posted the matter for further hearing on September 17."
Madhabi Puri Buch got salary from ICICI after joining SEBI: Congress; bank denies,Cdata,2024-09-03 04:20:18+05:30,"The Congress on Monday accused SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch of “holding an office of profit at ICICI Bank”, and receiving an income of Rs 16.80 crore between 2017 and 2024 after she became a whole-time member of the market regulator in 2017. However, ICICI Bank, in a statement to stock exchanges said the bank or its group companies have “not paid any salary or granted any ESOPs” to Buch after her retirement from the bank, other than her retiral benefits.

Speaking at a press conference, Pawan Khera, head of Congress media and publicity department, alleged: “In summary, the total amount received by the SEBI chairperson from ICICI from her time of joining SEBI in 2017 up until today total Rs 16,80,22,143, which is shockingly 5.09 times the income she received from SEBI during the same period, which amounts to Rs 3,30,28,246.”

“While people place their hopes in SEBI whose chairperson is appointed directly by the Prime Minister of India, they appear to have been conning us all along,” he alleged.

Khera said that “between 2017 and 2021, as a whole-time member of SEBI, the current SEBI chairperson received a salary from ICICI Bank amounting to Rs 12,63,47,239 (12.63 crore)”.

He said this is in “violation of Section 54 of the SEBI (Employees’ Service) Regulations, 2001, and Section 5 of SEBI’s Code on Conflict of Interests for Board Members (2008), both of which prohibit whole-time employees of SEBI from taking benefit from any other organisation and engaging in activities that entail in receiving a salary or fee”.

Khera alleged that between 2017 and 2024, as a whole-time member and later as the chairperson of SEBI, Buch also received income from ICICI Prudential amounting to Rs 22.41 lakh.

“Between 2021 and 2023, the current SEBI chairperson was also in receipt of ESOP from ICICI Bank amounting to Rs 2,84,12,918. This is in violation of Section X of the ICICI Employees Stock Option Scheme 2000,” alleged Khera.

He said that between 2021 and 2023, Buch “was also in receipt of TDS on the ESOP that was paid by ICICI Bank amounting to Rs 1.10 crore”.

“The said TDS amount is chargeable under salary and is again in violation of the SEBI Code of Conduct. This is a case of escapement of income tax as the benefit of TDS on ESOP paid by ICICI Bank is a prerequisite and again is liable for tax. This tax escape is Rs 50 lakh,” alleged Khera.

Hours later, ICICI Bank issued a statement to the stock exchanges denying the allegations. “ICICI Bank or its group companies have not paid any salary or granted any ESOPs to Ms Madhabi Puri Buch after her retirement, other than her retiral benefits,” it said.

“It may be noted that she had opted for superannuation with effect from October 31, 2013. During her employment with the ICICI Group, she received compensation in the form of salary, retiral benefits, bonus and ESOPs, in line with applicable policies,” the bank said.

“Under the bank’s ESOP rules, the ESOPs vest over the next few years from the date of allotment. As per rules existing at the time of her ESOP grant, employees including retired employees had the choice to exercise their ESOPs anytime up to a period of 10 years from the date of vesting. As per Income Tax rules, the difference between the price of the stock on the day of exercise and the allotment price is treated as perquisite income and is reflected in Part B of the Form16 of employees, including retired employees,” it said. “The bank is required to deduct the perquisite tax on this income. In addition, Form-16 covers the payment made towards the retiral benefits of former employees.”

A senior banker, who did not wish to be identified, told The Indian Express that there is no way that a publicly listed bank can pay salary to a former employee or a regulator.

“As per my understanding, the SEBI chairperson had received ESOPs from the bank as an employee of the bank when she worked there. Once the ESOPs get vested and the employee exercises his/her right to buy and accumulate them, as per the rules then, the employee can sell them within the expiry period of up to 10 years,” the banker said. “Since, ESOPs fall under perquisites, they are subject to taxes — difference between the exercise price and fair value of share at the time of vesting and also long term capital gains at the time of sale. So, I think the salary allegation that the Congress party is talking about is actually the ESOP perquisite that she had received at the time of employment at the bank.”

He further raised questions on the source of information presented by Congress. “While they presented an excel sheet, there is no mention of the source of the information and so it raises questions on the validity of the allegations.”

During the press conference, when Khera was asked about evidence to back the claims, he said: “Let them first challenge these facts, we will tell you, when to give the evidence and where. This is just the beginning. I told you, again I repeat, this is the tip of the iceberg.”

The opposition party also alleged that as a “whole-time member and chairperson of SEBI”, Buch “was not only drawing income from ICICI Bank but also adjudicating complaints against ICICI Bank and its affiliates”.

“This is a blatant violation of Code of Conduct on Conflict of Interests for Members of Board (2008),” Khera said.

Asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi “who is protecting the SEBI chairperson and why”, Khera questioned whether the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister, has “gone through these shocking facts about the SEBI chairperson or is the ACC completely outsourced to the PMO”.

Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge demanded that the SEBI chief be “dismissed immediately” and a JPC investigation into the “Adani Mega Scam”.

Addressing the PM in a post on X, he said: “You have appointed the first lateral entry chairperson of SEBI without any due diligence, this has put a black stain on its reputation and belittled the integrity of the market regulator.”

“Since the SEBI chairperson was appointed by Modi-Shah led committee, they cannot absolve themselves, from the new revelations involving charges of corruption!”"

"Hospitals to hospitality, F&B to cement: Mega industry players head to Bihar",Santosh Singh,2024-09-03 04:20:04+05:30,"From FMCG majors Britannia and PepsiCo to Tata Group’s Taj hotels to healthcare giant Medanta, several companies are making a beeline for Bihar — a state that, until a few years ago, was struggling to shed the image of an investment pariah. According to government officials, the state received Rs 12,000 crore worth of investment proposals between 2022 and 2024 — significantly higher than the Rs 2,500 crore received between 2016 and 2022.

Just last month, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar laid the foundation stone for a Rs 1,600-crore cement grinding unit of Ambuja Concrete North Private Ltd, a subsidiary of Adani Group’s Ambuja Cements, in Nawada. “Bihar has emerged as an ideal destination for investment,” a statement from his office said.

Like Adani Group’s Ambuja Cements, rivals JK Cement and Ultratech Cement too are setting up plants in the state.

A large portion of the investment proposals, officials say, are from the textile, leather, food processing, and cement industries.

According to state government officials, much of this improvement is down to the government allaying investors’ fears on the state’s law-and-order situation. A fortnight ago, Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary announced that the government was creating a land bank of at least 5,000 acres to accommodate all investment proposals.

In addition, it has ordered all of the state’s 38 districts to create industrial areas on priority.

According to data from the Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority (BIADA) — a state government agency to procure and lease government land to investors — some 7,592.39 acres of land has been leased out in the last two years as opposed to about 1,550 acres between 2016 and 2022.

Data also shows that this spike in investment proposals has meant that the agency had only 1,861.03 acres of land left, making it necessary to create a land bank.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Bihar Industries Minister Nitish Mishra said, “With a surge of investment proposals, mostly in textile, leather, cement and food processing sectors, the state cabinet had previously ordered (district administrations) to develop new industrial units in 31 districts that have already got industrial areas but have no land left. We also gave priority to creating industrial units in seven other districts that don’t have any industries.”

These seven districts are Arwal, Jamui, Kaimur, Saran, Sheohar, Sheikhpura and Banka. Mishra said that two industrial areas — Kumarbagh (West Champaran district) and Nawanagar (Buxar district) — have been earmarked to make special economic zones (SEZ) in the state. These sites are pending approval from the central government.

Besides Ambuja Cement, which is setting up plants in Nawada and Muzaffarpur, Ultratech (Bhagalpur and Khagaria), Star Cement (Begusarai and Patna), JK Laxmi Cement (Madhubani), JK Cement (Buxar) and Shree Cement (Madhubani and Begusarai) have also announced plants in the state.

The Tata Group-led Indian Hotels Company Limited opened a 124-room Taj City Centre in Patna, worth Rs 500 crore, in July last year — the first five-star hotel in the state — and PepsiCo, which set up a Rs 500 crore plant in Begusarai, is setting up a second unit in Buxar.

“In food processing, we have Dadiji Farmtech and SBPJ Foods coming to Vaishali and Pramod Laddu (Pramod Confectionery & Food Products) and Sona Biscuit in Patna,” Mishra said. “These are part of 40 investment proposals worth about Rs 10,798 crore that are at various stages of approval. Nineteen of them have already been allotted land. In other cases, land is being identified.”

Among the major investments in the state was the opening of the Jay Prabha Medanta Hospital in Patna. Inaugurated by the CM in November 2021, the Rs 800-crore hospital stands on seven acres of land and operates on a private-public-partnership model.

“At present, we have 330 beds, with plans to extend it to 600,” said its medical director Dr Ravishankar Singh. “We see over 1,000 patients in the OPD every day. This is perhaps the only health sector enterprise in the PPP model that has been very successful in the state.”

Khurshid Ahmad, who leads ‘Moon Hoon Bihar’ — a unique initiative that aims at holding dialogues on subjects of health, education, art and culture in order to boost investments — said the state had been seeing an increase in private investments, especially in the health sector, in the last five years. Main Hoon Bihar is credited with having been the bridge between private investors and the state government.

“The entry of private players like Medanta and Ruban Memorial Hospital into the state’s health sector has helped take the load off government hospitals,” he said.

Industry experts also hail the inflow of money into agro-based sectors.

“Although the surge of investment in areas such as garment, tannery and cement is a good sign, Bihar’s mainstay is food processing since we have the raw materials — rice, maize, makhana, potatoes, mango and lichi,” said Bihar Industries Association president K P S Keshri said. “In the past too, we thrived on agro-industries such as sugarcane. Therefore, it’s good to see the central and state government discussing the food processing industry in terms of investments now.”

But challenges remain, with one private player who did not wish to be named citing issues such as land availability, drainage, basic infrastructure and the ease of doing business as some of the major hiccups.

“The single window system has to be more robust and the bureaucratic rigmarole has to be cut down even further. But overall, we have come to a promising Bihar with a fresh market and that needs to be explored,” this investor said.

Industry minister Mishra concurred with this assessment. “Besides land and infrastructure concerns, investors are also a bit concerned about possible labour unrest if trade unions are present. They also wanted extended duration of government incentives such as grants and subsidies. They also expect sound inter-department coordination for a healthy working atmosphere,” he said.

According to Bihar deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, the state’s priority now is to create its land bank. “As other states face a saturation in terms of big investments, we hope to offer Bihar as the all-new investment destination,” he told The Indian Express."

Hearing an appeal by Haryana, challenging the Punjab and Haryana HC order asking it “to open at least the barricades at Shambhu border within a week to relieve the general public of inconvenience”, the SC had earlier mooted an amicable settlement to the dispute and sought names for constituting a committee to talk to the farmers.

Accordingly, the committee asked the two states to give their suggestions on who should be part of the committee.

Perusing the names given by the states, the SC said, “All the names suggested by the States of Punjab and Haryana are eminent, distinct in their respective fields and are above board. They are persons of high integrity with a dedicated commitment to the field of their specialisation, with special expertise in the field of agriculture and firsthand knowledge of the hardships being experienced by the rural people

including farmers… We acknowledge their contribution towards agricultural growth and are of the view that their legitimate aspirations, if not enforceable rights, also deserve empathy and due consideration by the Committee, while examining the larger issues which are confronting the farming community in the States of Punjab and Haryana.”

Modi said youngsters should become BJP members so that they realise “the bad days their parents had seen. There were corruption allegations. Even getting a telephone or gas connection was difficult.” He said that to expand presence in remote tribal areas, workers should go to those who got pucca houses after generations.

“Our border villages are not the last villages but the first villages of our country. We should start membership drive in those first villages.

Tiger attacks animal handler at Australia’s Dreamworld amusement park,Unknown,2024-09-03 03:31:36+05:30,"A tiger attacked an animal handler at Dreamworld amusement park in Coomera, Queensland, on Monday morning, leaving the woman hospitalized with serious injuries.

The 47-year-old experienced handler suffered significant lacerations and puncture wounds to her arm during the incident, which occurred shortly before 9 a.m. local time.

Queensland Ambulance Service director Justin Payne reported that park staff quickly managed the bleeding and called for an ambulance.

The handler was transported to Gold Coast University Hospital and is currently in stable condition. Payne noted that she appeared pale and unwell upon arrival but is otherwise stable.

The attack happened just as Dreamworld, Australia’s largest theme park, was preparing to open to the public. The park is known for its ""Tiger Island"" exhibit, which houses nine Sumatran and Bengal tigers.

The exhibit offers visitors an interactive experience where they can get close to the tigers during feeding times. The park’s website promotes the opportunity to witness the tigers' “might and raw power.”

In a statement, Dreamworld described the attack as an “isolated and rare incident” and emphasized their immediate focus on supporting the injured staff member. The park declined to provide details about the tiger involved in the attack or its current status.

Past Incidents

Tiger attacks in theme parks and zoos are rare but not unheard of. Notable incidents include a 2020 attack at Zurich Zoo and a 2019 attack at a Kansas zoo.

Dreamworld has experienced similar issues in the past; in 2011, a Bengal tiger named Keto bit two handlers in separate incidents.

Despite the incident, Dreamworld remained open to the public on Monday. An investigation into the attack is underway, and the park continues to operate while prioritizing the welfare of its staff and visitors.

"In new Bengal Bill, death sentence for rape if victim dies, becomes vegetative",Atri Mitra,2024-09-03 03:25:14+05:30,"Aiming to create a “safer environment for women and children” in the state by amending and introducing provisions related to rape and sexual offences, the West Bengal government’s newly drafted anti-rape Bill proposes capital punishment rape convicts if their actions result in victims’ death or send them into a vegetative state.

The Bill, titled ‘Aparajita Woman and Child Bill (West Bengal Criminal Laws and Amendment) Bill 2024’, will be tabled in the Assembly Tuesday. The government has called a two-day special session starting Monday in the wake of the rape-murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata’s RG Kar Medical College and Hospital last month.

The draft states that other convicts of rape and gangrape would receive a life sentence lasting for the “rest of their natural lives”.

The draft Bill proposes to amend provisions of the newly passed Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita 2023, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, “in their application to the state of West Bengal to enhance punishment and to constitute the framework for…expeditious investigation and trial of the heinous act of violence against women and children.”

Proposing significant changes to the investigation and prosecution process, the Bill stipulates that probes into rape cases must be completed within 21 days of the initial report, a reduction from the previous two-month deadline. The Bill states, “If it is not possible to complete the investigation within the period of 21 days from the date of information recorded by the officer-in-charge of the police station, then the said period can be further extended not exceeding 15 days by any police officer not below the rank of superintendent of police or equivalent, after recording the reasons in writing in the case diary maintained under Section 192 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023.”

The amendments also propose to establish fast-track courts for such cases. “To expedite investigations and ensure swift justice for victims, this Bill proposes dedicated special courts and investigation teams. These specialised units will be equipped with the necessary resources and expertise to handle cases of rape of women and sexcual offences against children efficiently, effectively and timely, thereby minimising the trauma experienced by victims and their families,” the draft Bill states.

The Bill says an “Aparajita Task Force” will be constituted to investigate cases of rape or atrocities on women and children. It says the task force shall be formed at the district level and be headed by a deputy superintendent of police for the investigation of these offences."

Volkswagen planning to shut plants in Germany amid profitability problems,Unknown,2024-09-03 02:44:26+05:30,"The Germany based automobile manufacturer Volkswagen is planning to shutter its factories in the country as it is grappling with profit margin due to increased competition from its Asian competitors.

According to a New York Times report, Volkswagen’s consideration to shut down factories in Germany would be the first in the 87 years history and it will also break the decades old promise of a job security for workers.

The automobile major said that the situation remains ""tense” and a simple cost-cutting measure won’t suffice the need of the hour.

“In the current situation, even plant closures at vehicle production and component sites can no longer be ruled out without swift countermeasures,” the company said in a statement.

Volkswagen also added, “The situation is extremely tense and cannot be resolved through simple cost-cutting measures.”

One of the powerful automobile workers' unions, IG Metall, has stated that it will oppose any kind of job cuts in the factories by Volkswagen.

"Week after heavy rains, hundred of houses remain flooded in Gujarat’s Mandvi town",Gopal B Kateshiya,2024-09-03 02:42:06+05:30,"A week after Mandvi town was flooded following extremely heavy rainfall, waterlogging is persisting in this coastal town in Kutch and around 1000 houses remained affected on Monday even as the government deployed 15 dewatering pumps to address the issue.

Houses in around seven societies in Babavadi, Rameshwar Zupadpatti and Jogivas Salaya areas remained waterlogged for the seventh consecutive day on Monday. Around 1000 households remained affected, locals said. “Waterlogging is very high in Madhavnagar 1, 2 and 3 societies in Babavadi area. In fact, water levels are waist-high in Madhavnagar-3 and people’s homes are still flooded,” Vijaysinh Jadeja, a resident of Bakalivadi in Babavadi area told The Indian Express on Monday evening, adding the backside of his house also remained water-logged. “The water is stinking. So are household belongings post the flooding,” he said.

Sanjay Patel, chief officer of Mandvi municipality said that besides Madhavnagar 1, 2 and 3, heavy waterlogging persisted in Nityanand Babavadi, Meghmangalnagar, Jaynagar, Vijaynagar, Padmavatinagar etc in the posh western part of the town as well as Jogivas and Rameshwar Zupadpatti. “We are distributing food packets and drinking water in four to five societies in these areas as waterlogging levels are high,” Patel said, adding, “While the waters are receding in natural course since the rain halted on Friday morning, we have also deployed 15 dewatering pumps and three electric motor-pumps to clear floodwaters and we are expecting the situation to normalise in around a day’s time.”

The western part of the town as well as the low-lying area in Salaya harbour area of Mandvi were flooded as extremely heavy rainfalls started pounding the area since the intervening night of August 25 and 26 under the influence of a deep depression which had moved to Kutch district. By the time the heavy downpour stopped at around 8 AM on August 30, Mandvi had logged around 35 inches of precipitation. Heavy flow of runoff from villages like Bharapar, Rayan Patiya, Vada, Don Bhadai, Dhokda flooded part of the Mandvi as Topansar lake in the heart of the town couldn’t handle the inflow. A record high-level flood in Rukmavati river which flows through the eastern part of the town made the matters worse, say officers.

Tushar Joshi, a consulting accountant who lives in Madhavnagar-3 told The Indian Express over phone on Monday evening that the front yard of his house was still under water. “The water is still on the first step of of entrance of my residence and we are afraid to venture out even as we are running low on daily essentials,” he said, adding, “However, water is receding gradually and we heaved a sigh of relief when water receded from ground floor of my house on Saturday night.”

Joshi’s house stands on a 4.5 feet-high plinth and he said that streets in his area were under water more than knee-deep.

In Meghmangal Nagar, Dr Harshad Udeshi, a 72-year-old physician and his elderly wife were stuck in their flooded house for five days. “I waded through waist-deep waters for around 100 feet to go out on Saturday as the battery of my phone was on the verge of being exhausted. Thankfully, waters receded from my house on Monday (September 2) but streets surrounding my house are still severely water-logged and snakes are a constant threat,” he said.

But the chief officer (CO) said that the inflow in Topansar lake had reduced by Monday evening. “The inflow in the lake has reduced to a manageable level. Now, the inflow and outflow is the same,” Patel said, adding “We removed a culvert from Nagnath Mandir Road which was impeding flow of floodwaters overflowing Topansar.”

The CO further said that electricity supply was restored in entire Mandvi on Sunday and that the municipality supplied piped drinking water to residents on Monday.

Jadeja said that the municipality will have to remove encroachment from the course of natural drain which channels waters overflowing Topansar lake to Rukmavati river. “Near Swaminarayan temple, the drain has been covered with RCC structure and hence not amenable to cleaning. Apparently it will not be able to handle such large volumes of water if not cleaned regularly,” 49-year-old Jadeja who executes civil work contracts in Kutch added.

Kesar Chaudhary, deputy municipal commissioner of Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation who has served as sub-divisional magistrate of Mundra in the past and who has been camping in Mandvi for the past few days to guide the municipality tackle the situation, agrees. “One obvious reason for persistent waterlogging is that topography of some parts of Mandvi town is like a tea saucer from where water won’t drain in naturally and it will have to be pumped out. When an area like Mandvi gets 36 inches of rain within three-four days, the problem becomes severe and some long-term solution will have to be found to prevent recurrence of such a situation in future,” he said."
"Data: Rain intensifies towards August-end, rise in Sept share",Ritu Sharma,2024-09-03 02:30:07+05:30,"Monsoon has been increasingly intensifying in Gujarat towards the end of August with September’s rainfall receipt also on the rise, shows data from the past 10 years.

According to the rainfall data maintained by the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC) Gandhinagar from 2015, this is the fourth year in the past 10 years when the season’s average rainfall has crossed the 100-per cent mark in the state in August.

The average monsoon rainfall recorded were at 103 per cent, 120 per cent and 101 per cent towards August-end in 2017, 2020 and 2022 respectively.

Further, the rainfall receipt in September has been on a rise in the past five years — the highest of more than 50 per cent of the total monsoon average recorded in 2021. Notably, Gujarat saw less than 100 per cent — 98 per cent — average rainfall in 2021.

The September trend is expected to continue this year, too, as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast has predicted above normal rainfall for the month.

According to the SEOC data, there is a significant spike in the rainfall receipt (see table) between August 31 and September 30 over the past 10 years.

“So far this year, the major share of rainfall that Gujarat received was due to the recent depression that turned into a cyclonic storm Asna.

Vadodara deluge: State govt requests insurers to consider repairs of heavily submerged vehicles,Aditi Raja,2024-09-03 02:14:12+05:30,"In the aftermath of damage to vehicles due to the Vadodara deluge, the Gujarat government has requested insurance companies to consider repair of private four-wheelers up to the current value of vehicles if the owners do not wish to concede a “total loss” as per policies.

During a meeting held with public sector and private insurance companies, Vadodara Collector Bijal Shah, on behalf of the government, also communicated to the insurance companies to consider claims of retail traders for loss of goods if endorsed by the civic body and substantiated by photographs.

Following a series of review meetings on Monday with Minister of State for Home, Harsh Sanghavi, who is also the guardian minister of Vadodara, Bijal Shah and Vadodara city BJP chief Dr Vijay Shah met insurance companies to discuss the issue of damage caused to private vehicles and goods of retail traders.

At the meeting, collector Shah requested the insurance companies to consider repair of cars if the vehicle owners insist on the same, instead of classifying severely drowned vehicles as “total loss” as per insurance norms. “We have requested the insurance companies to allow owners to choose repairs instead of total loss to the vehicle up to the limit of the insured value of the vehicle… The insurance companies have shown a positive response. We will take this forward in the meetings with them in the days to come to expedite the surveys, repairs and settlement of claims for the common people,” Bijal Shah told The Indian Express.

According to a senior official, the government has also raised concern on the issue of disposal of a huge number of vehicles that would be classified under ‘total loss’ as per the vehicle insurance policies that classify flooded cars in three categories — A (flooded upto floor-level), B (submerged upto seat-level) and C (water level above dashboard).

“Insurance companies have been asked to consider if Category C cars can be repaired up to the insured value because Vadodara is a city with a huge middle-class population and although for the insurance company, the value of a vehicle will be the current depreciated price, for the owner the cost is the purchasing price… We have communicated to the insurance companies to bring out any bottle-necks they are facing so that the government can extend logistical support in expediting the process,” said Vijay Shah.

He added that the insurance companies have been requested to call in surveyors from other cities to Vadodara to expedite the survey and to ensure that automobiles are repaired and returned to the owners, as far as possible.

At the meeting, the Collector also requested insurance companies to consider the self-attested claims of traders for loss of goods with endorsement from the civic body and also supported by photographs and videography of the goods before they are disposed of.

On Monday, the meeting with insurance companies was held within hours after Sanghavi, who was on his third visit to Vadodara since the flood waters receded on August 29, met representatives from the Vadodara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) and various retail traders associations assuring that the government would “intervene” in settling claims for losses incurred. VCCI president Himanshu Patel urged the government to waive off ‘property tax’ as relief for small and medium enterprises of Vadodara.

Paresh Parikh, president of the Traders’ Association of Vadodara, urged the government to appoint a team of surveyors to provide relief to traders who have suffered losses.

During his visit, Sanghavi termed that the public in Vadodara was angry “because of the belief and trust placed” in the state government. “People show their anger on those who they place their trust in and we understand that… We are doing our best to ensure that Vadodara is up and about again, especially with the upcoming festivals. We will ensure that Ganesh Chaturthi and Navratri are celebrated with grandeur in the city as every year,” the minister said.

The government will discuss in detail the Vishwamitri River project on Tuesday in Gandhinagar, he added. Sanghavi informed that the government has so far distributed cash doles, including that for restoration of homes, to 64,360 families in the city limit and 20,610 families in the district."

"Govt nod to 30 tall buildings, 25 to come up in Ahmedabad",Cdata,2024-09-03 01:24:21+05:30,"The state government has approved at least 30 skyscrapers across Ahmedabad, Surat, Gandhinagar, and Vadodara. The development comes in the backdrop of the revised regulations published on 27 May 2021 that permits buildings with a maximum Floor Space Index (FSI) of 5.4 along with premium FSI, which exceeds the base FSI, encouraging developers to invest in vertical growth.

The local bodies have generated around Rs 1,000 crore in revenue through premium FSI, the state government shared on Monday in an official statement.

Among the 30 approved, 25 skyscrapers will come up in Ahmedabad; Surat and Gandhinagar to each have two and Vadodara to have one. Of these, 20 are residential, seven commercial, two mixed use, and one is a public building.

“This surge in vertical development has generated significant revenue, with approximately Rs 1,000 crore received by local bodies through premium FSI,” the state government said in a release.

“The completion of several projects is anticipated before Diwali, further enhancing the state’s urban landscape. These buildings are not only setting new records in height but also incorporating advanced construction technologies such as Mivan formwork, shear walls, and skywalks at terrace levels,” said the statement. “Additionally, provision for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure ensures that these developments are future-ready,” the release said.

A Special Technical Committee, chaired by Principal Secretary of Urban Development and Urban Housing Department, has been established to assess the feasibility of the projects. “As we celebrate Skyscraper Day on September 3, Gujarat stands as a symbol of progress, innovation, and a vision for future.

Why Nitesh Kumar’s first call after Paralympics gold in para badminton was to defending champion Pramod Bhagat,Shivani Naik,2024-09-03 01:02:54+05:30,"The gold had to stay in India – that was the tacit promise Nitesh Kumar had made Pramod Bhagat when he left for France.

It’s why after Nitesh won India’s second Paralympics title at Paris, the first in badminton of 2024, defending the Standing / Lower limb (SL3 category) gold, his first call was placed to 2021 Games champion Bhagat, who was serving a whereabouts suspension back home. “Immediately after winning, I called him and said, ‘More than me winning gold, it was important that we keep the SL3 title in India,” Nitesh said, of establishing an Indian dynasty in this hugely contested classification.

Britisher Daniel Bethell, who lost his second successive Paralympics final to an Indian, would’ve been distraught, after holding a championship point. But Nitesh had completely altered his game-style for the final, bitten back on the flashy dazzle of strokes and pushed Bethell into a corner of impatience. Knowing Bhagat’s hard-earned gold needed doughty defending, he would rather play dour for 80 minutes than blink.

“It’s funny because the first person in my life who ever told me that I have good badminton strokes was Pramod bhaiyya in 2016 right after we met,” Nitesh recalls.

Nitesh, always well built and fit, grew up in a Haryana village, as a prodigious footballer with loping strides and great dribbling skills. “Football for us wasn’t about watching European leagues on TV but playing it at school. I also played volleyball and basketball and TT,” he recalls, of acing studies and sports both, looking forward to a bright future. Then tragedy struck, and he lost a leg to a train accident soon after he had cracked IIT Mandi and started on electrical engineering.

“I won’t call it a bad memory. I moved on, even if not quickly. It happened and I was in shock not knowing what to do with life, and out of ideas. But my father insisted all wasn’t lost. Then when I saw others at Artificial Limb Centre and what all they are capable of, I resurrected my dream,” Nitesh recalls.

Badminton had started for recreation, because his University had a rather fetching wooden court. “After the accident when I got into Pata sports, I was surrounded by multiple national and world champions in SL3. I guess that’s what they mean by sports culture of excellence. I surprisingly got along straight away with Pramod bhaiyya who was world Champion. I thought maybe as ‘star player’ he won’t even notice me. But he walked up to me and told me I have good strokes,” Nitesh says.

Studying to crack IIT demanded sacrifices of its own and solitude, but preparing for Paralympics was another set of challenges. “That was the time of Virat Kohli’s peak. And I was impressed with his dedication to top fitness, and how his diet, schedule was aimed towards that. His self belief was an inspiration in how no sacrifice is too big to chase winning,” he says.

When Bhagat was sidelined with the suspension, India still had a bunch of shuttlers in SL3, but Bethell had looked primed to trap his elusive gold. Nitesh had played all his matches at Paris on corner courts, but knew when dropped into the spotlight, against a pumped up Bethell, he needed something special: in his case eschewing all attack, and defending solidly including in 100+ shot rallies.

“First set, I usually don’t play so patiently. My playing style is very different. I usually trust my strokes, which are deceptive and have variety, instead of playing long rallies. But in those first 3-4 points, I saw there was drift and Daniel was far too desperate and I shouldn’t play too many strokes. Shuttle and venue were tricky so I decided to continue playing with a plain racquet. In between I did a few variations. Few worked for me, few didn’t work,” he says.

Midway through the second, Nitesh knew he was struggling to send the shuttle back due to court drift, and getting caught at the net where Bethell charged. “I lost my nerve and got too eager. I’d lost similarly at the Asiad finals. I didn’t want to make that mistake again. 19-20 down in decider also I told myself the game is not over. I should fight for this point. I’ve come this long that I don’t want to lose from the brink. I just told myself I’m sticking it out there and I’ll make him earn this point. But I won the point quickly,” as Bethell sent the shuttle long.

Ultimately, it was that heavy responsibility of the gold that kept him from imploding and giving it all away. “Even when I won the first set, I didn’t assume I’m winning today. Until it happened I didn’t want to have that feeling,” he recalls. It hadn’t sunk in till he heard Bhagat tell him he was proud of him. The gold would stay in India."

"Suicide bombing in Afghanistan’s capital Kabul kills six, injures 13",Unknown,2024-09-03 00:38:14+05:30,"A suicide bomber detonated explosives in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing at least six people and injuring 13 others, according to local police and the Ministry of Interior Affairs. The explosion occurred on Monday in the Qala-e-Bakhtiar area of southern Kabul.

Among the victims was a woman, and all those injured were civilians who were taken to the hospital for treatment. An investigation is underway, but no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.

Although violence in Afghanistan has decreased since the Taliban took over in 2021, the ISIL (ISIS) affiliate in Khorasan Province remains active, frequently targeting civilians, foreigners, and Taliban officials.

This group is considered the largest security threat in Afghanistan and has also targeted Shia communities.

One of the most deadly ISIL-linked attacks since the Taliban's rise to power occurred in 2022 when a suicide bombing at a Kabul education center killed at least 53 people, including 46 girls and young women.

The last suicide attack claimed by ISIL in Afghanistan was in March, in the city of Kandahar.

Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid recently claimed that ISIL had been ""suppressed very hard"" and that no groups existed in Afghanistan that could pose a significant threat, though Monday's attack suggests ongoing security challenges.

UN-sanctioned Libyan human trafficker killed in Tripoli,Unknown,2024-09-03 00:33:27+05:30,"A prominent Libyan human trafficker sanctioned by the United Nations, Abdel-Rahman Milad, was shot dead on Sunday in the capital, Tripoli, according to Libyan officials.

His death has sparked tension in the western region of the North African country.

Milad, who previously commanded a coast guard unit in the western town of Zawiya, was targeted by unknown assailants. The details surrounding his death remain unclear, and no group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

According to local media reports, Milad was shot while inside his vehicle in the Sayyad area, located in the western part of Tripoli, as reported by AP.

Both officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity for their safety, confirmed the incident. The Tripoli-based government, led by Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, is yet to comment on Milad's killing, AP reported.

Moammar Dhawi, a militia leader in western Libya, expressed grief over Milad's death and called for an investigation to hold the perpetrators accountable in a statement posted on Facebook.

Libya has been mired in corruption and instability since the NATO-backed uprising that ousted and killed longtime dictator Muammar Gadhafi in 2011.

The country has since been divided between two rival administrations, each supported by armed groups and foreign powers.

Amid this chaos, Libya has become a major transit point for migrants from Africa and the Middle East attempting to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea.

In June 2018, the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Milad and five other leaders of criminal networks for their involvement in human trafficking and smuggling operations in Libya.

Milad, identified as the head of a coast guard unit in Zawiya, was accused of perpetrating violence against migrants and rival smugglers.

UN experts alleged that Milad and his coast guard members were directly involved in sinking migrant boats using firearms, a claim Milad denied, blaming traffickers for wearing similar uniforms.

Despite this, Milad was imprisoned for six months (October 2020 - April 2021) on charges related to human trafficking and fuel smuggling.

"Sumit Antil defends Paralympic title javelin: ‘He brings us gold ornaments but his gold medals are biggest gifts’, says mother",Nitin Sharma,2024-09-03 00:31:15+05:30,"As she watched her son 26-year-old Sumit Antil win the gold medal in the men’s F64 javelin throw final in the Paris Olympics at the family’s new home in the village Khewra near Sonepat in Haryana, Nirmala Devi is reminded of a wall from the older home. The wall of fame had Antil’s nine world record marks from 2019 onwards. That wall now is going to get a new entry: 70.59m.

“I don’t understand those numbers but I know that he has won the gold medal. Jab bhi ghar ata hai toh kehta hai ki uska competition khud se hi hai (Whenever he comes home, he tells us that his competition is only with himself). To see the Indian flag high had been his dream since childhood and that’s what he has done again in Paris,” the mother shares with The Indian Express.

Antil’s best throw on Monday was 3.56m better than what silver medallist Dulan Kodithuwakku of Sri Lanka managed. In fact, the Indian had two more throws that were better than anything that the rest of the field managed.

Antil, who first set the world record in 2019 with a 61.32m throw in the F 64 category, where athletes with moderately affected movement in one or both the legs or the absence of limbs compete, is the current world record holder with a mark of 73.29m set in Asian Para games last year. In between, Antil has broken the world record seven times including three world records during his title triumph in Tokyo Paralympics.

No one in World Para Athletics has maintained such a long record of having bettered their own world record multiple times like Antil. Devi credits this hunger to her late husband Ram Kumar, an Indian Air Force mechanic, who died of cancer in 2004.

Sumit Antil’s mother Nirmala Devi says, “To see the Indian flag high had been his dream since childhood and that’s what he has done again in Paris.” (Sumit Antil on Instagram) Sumit Antil’s mother Nirmala Devi says, “To see the Indian flag high had been his dream since childhood and that’s what he has done again in Paris.” (Sumit Antil on Instagram)

“My husband was a junior warrant officer with the Indian Air Force and worked as the mechanic at Air Force bases like Jamnagar, Kalaikunda, Srinagar and Chennai Air Force Stations. During his tenure, he would be the one who could fix any kind of malfunction in the Air Force vehicles and had several commendation certificates. Sumit ka world record todne ka junoon bhi uske pita ke junoon se aya hai (Sumit’s ability to improve his world mark has come from his father’s passion),” says Devi.

Rising from adversity

Monday marked 9 years, 3 months and 4 days since the then 16-year-old’s bike was hit by a tractor on the Sonepat-Dewra road while returning home from tuitions. The left leg had to be amputated. Antil had earlier shared about his 53-day ordeal at the hospital.

“I only thought about becoming a wrestler along with my studies and dreamt about getting a job to support my family post my father’s demise. I had made the call to the ambulance when the accident happened. The only thought when my left leg was amputated was about restarting my life. Yes, there were moments when I felt low but I had this belief in myself that I would not let my life go to waste due to this,” Antil had said.

A trip to Pune for getting a prosthetic leg from the family’s savings was followed by a meeting with para athlete Raj Kumar. Initially, he trained under Para Asian Games medallist Virender Dhankar before working with the Dronacharya awardee coach Naval Singh from 2018. Sumit, who used to throw 45m then, also arranged three lakhs to go to Finland to train with the 1988 Olympics gold medallist Tapio Korjus.

.“Like Neeraj Chopra, Sumit had the natural ability to jerk. But in Sumit’s case, the skin on his knee would be bruised after using the prosthetic leg. Since he used to wrestle, he had good upper body strength and we used to make him throw the shot put to develop his lower body. After his classification was done with a throw of 52.72m in 2018, he made a throw of 59.45m in the Para Asian games trials,” recalls Naval Singh.

“I would take multiple attempts to set up my run-up as I used the left leg to block the body and it all depended on the condition of my bruised knee,” he had told this newspaper in the past. “Vipin Kasana bhai would tell me not to pull my hand back and to put the focus on hips coming ahead first. I also saw the Finnish throwers using different angles.” All-round development in his technique led to multiple world records.

His mother Devi also talks about his wife. “Sheetal keeps track of all his records and she has brought luck to his life! He tells her that he could cross the 70m mark after his marriage! While he always brings us gold ornaments from his trips abroad, the biggest gift for all of us are his gold medals,” says the mother."
"US seizes plane used by Venezuelan president Maduro, citing sanctions violations",Unknown,2024-09-03 00:26:56+05:30,"The US government has confiscated a plane frequently utilised by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, alleging it was illicitly acquired via a shell company and subsequently smuggled out of the United States in defiance of sanctions and export control regulations.

The Dassault Falcon 900EX, which was seized in the Dominican Republic, is now in the custody of federal officials in Florida, according to a statement released by the Justice Department on Monday.

US authorities claim that associates linked to the Venezuelan leader used a shell company based in the Caribbean to obscure their involvement in the plane's purchase, which was initially valued at $13 million.

The aircraft was exported from the US to Venezuela through the Caribbean in April 2023, in what officials describe as a deliberate attempt to bypass an executive order prohibiting US persons from engaging in business with the Maduro regime.

The plane, registered in San Marino, had been widely used by Maduro for international travel, including visits earlier this year to Guyana and Cuba.

""Let this seizure send a clear message: aircraft illegally acquired from the United States for the benefit of sanctioned Venezuelan officials cannot just fly off into the sunset,” said Matthew Axelrod, an assistant secretary for export enforcement at the Commerce Department.

This action comes shortly after Venezuela's controversial presidential election, where electoral authorities aligned with the ruling party, declared Maduro the winner without providing detailed results.

The lack of transparency has sparked widespread international condemnation. Meanwhile, the opposition claimed that their review of over 80% of the vote tally sheets showed Maduro was defeated by a significant margin by former diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez.

The same plane had also been used last December to transport several Americans, who had been imprisoned for years in Venezuela, to Canouan Island in the Caribbean.

These individuals were exchanged for Alex Saab, a businessman and close Maduro ally who was jailed in the US on charges of money laundering.

In March, the aircraft flew to the Dominican Republic, accompanied by a Venezuelan-registered plane, reportedly for maintenance. However, it never departed from the country.

The US has also imposed sanctions on 55 Venezuelan-registered planes owned by the state oil giant PDVSA and has offered a $15 million reward for Maduro’s arrest on federal drug trafficking charges in New York."
Punjab Speaker summons DGP with report on ASI booked for graft; Khaira says ‘personal enmity’,Kanchan Vasdev,2024-09-03 00:21:13+05:30,"Punjab Assembly Speaker Kultar Singh Sandhwan Monday summoned state police chief Gaurav Yadav to personally appear before him on Tuesday and submit a report on an assistant sub-inspector who has been accused of receiving money from a gangster. This sparked a sharp reaction from Congress leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira who accused Sandhwan of having a “personal enmity” with ASI Bohar Singh.

The ASI, posted at Kotkapura (city) police station, was booked under Section 7 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and “suspended on August 24 as per the protocol,” Faridkot’s SSP, Pragya Jain, said.

“I have asked the DGP to come to my office personally and give a report in the case on Tuesday itself,” Sandhwan told The Indian Express,

Earlier, the Speaker mentioned the FIR against the ASI during the zero hour on the first day of the three-day session of the Assembly and sought permission from the House to seek a report from DGP Yadav in the case.

Sandhwan, who represents the Kotkapura Assembly segment as AAP MLA, said the ASI allegedly received money from a gangster through a bank transfer. An FIR was registered against the ASI under the relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act on the statement of the gangster, Sandhwan said. He said the persons who wanted to save the accused should also be exposed.

While seeking House’s permission to seek report from the DGP, the Speaker asked AAP MLA and Kunwar Vijay Pratap, a retired IAS officer, as to how such cases should be dealt with. Kunwar Vijay Pratap is known for taking on hos own party’s government on several issues.

“I feel the mother of all ailments is corruption. Punjab government is very harsh on corruption. Cases come to light. If action is delayed then the effect is gone. Kunwar ji has been in police. I want to take his advice. This FIR was registered against Bohar Singh…on gangster’s complaint. If a police officer becomes so daring that he started taking money, then it becomes a difficult situation,” the Speaker said.

Sandhwan, then, ignoring Cabinet Minister Aman Arora’s advice that crusade against corruption should not be in bits and pieces, went ahead and asked the DGP to submit a report that should also detail “who all were trying to resist action against the ASI and why the FIR was not included in the daily crime report given to the media”.

Kunwar Vijay, the Amritsar North MLA, meanwhile, said that a transfer policy should be implemented to break the nexus between police and gangsters.

“Such people are there in all departments. Black sheep are already there. Cases are registered. The trial goes on for 8-10 years. Then they get acquitted. There should be a transfer policy. Officers should be transferred after a year and a half. This breaks the nexus,” he said.

He added, “I have been sitting in Vidhan Sabha since 2006 in some capacity or the other. Problem is that mafia controls the governments.”

The MLA reminded the Speaker that he (Kunwar Vijay) resigned from the IPS even though he had nine years of service left.

“You know in what circumstances I quit my job…There are such people in police and other departments and they openly challenge the system. Who runs the system? Mafia has the biggest role in running a government. The entire system is run by the mafia and if we break the mafia rule then ‘Ram Rajya’ can come,” he added.

Congress member Pargat Singh claimed that two to three policemen at each station in the state are “drug addicts” and were thus part of the mafia. He said he had earlier requested that a dope test should be conducted on all police employees. “The CMs can keep saying they will end this menace. We should do something before it is too late.”

Senior Congress leader and leader of opposition Partap Singh Bajwa said if the ASI received money from the gangster, he should have been immediately dismissed and necessary proceedings started against him. “Speaker sahib you have bird’s eye view. You should get the orders issued immediately”.

Bajwa also raised the issue of an interview of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, and wanted a report sought in this matter as well.

Bishnoi was interviewed by a private news channel last year when the gangster was in the Punjab police custody in Mohali’s Kharar. Another interview was conducted in Rajasthan last year.

Intervening in the matter, Finance Minister Cheema said the Speaker has all the powers to call a report from any officer and therefore, he thinks that there is no need for the permission of the House.

On the Bishnoi case, Cheema said the matter is sub-judice.

Cabinet minister Aman Arora suggested that a mechanism in consultation with the chief minister be set up to deal with cases where corruption is established.

“If we bring a single example then it will open the Pandora’s box. If we work on pick and choose, then politics will go on and nothing worthwhile will happen,” he said.

Meanwhile, Congress MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira said he felt that the Speaker has a “personal vested interest against the ASI” or through him he wanted to target his political opponents.

“Speaker misused the vital platform of Vidhan Sabha to settle personal scores…seeking mandate of the Assembly to seek report from DGP Punjab as to why the said ASI has not been arrested despite a PC ACT case against him in his hometown,” Khaira said on X.

The Congress leader asked if personal enmity of the Speaker was more important in Vidhan Sabha or “the pending issues of justice in Beadbi and prosecution sanction in the Dera head case or action against officers for facilitating interview of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi in police custody or agriculture policy as demanded by farmers or Buddha Nullah issue polluting waters of Punjab”."
"Under pressure, new UK govt suspends 30 of its 350 arms export licenses to Israel",Unknown,2024-09-03 00:18:43+05:30,"Amid the ongoing Israel-Gaza war, the United Kingdom has announced partial sanctions on Israel as Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK is suspending approximately 30 export licenses for military equipment.

The UK government reviewed its international humanitarian law in the course of the warfare of Israel’s military operations in Gaza and eventually revoked 30 licenses out of a total of around 350 military equipment, which includes components for military aircraft, helicopters, drones and items which facilitate ground targeting.

The government in its report concluded that there was a serious threat that the artillery exported to Israel might be used by the country against Gaza in violation of international humanitarian law.

The UK has been under pressure to halt the supply of arms and artillery to Israel due to the growing number of fatalities in the Gaza war and the destruction of public utilities and infrastructure.

Protests have erupted across Israel and have created havoc for the PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to secure a ceasefire deal with Hamas militant group based in Gaza and get 101 Israeli hostages back who are supposedly still alive.

The Israel-Gaza war began last year in October when Hamas militants attacked the country and reportedly killed 1,200 Israeli while taking 250 hostages with them. In response, Israel has killed close to 41,000 Palestinians and thousands have been destabilized from their homes, according Gaza’s health ministry."
"Paris Paralympics: With mixed team archery bronze, Sheetal Devi adds another chapter to glorious legacy",Nitin Sharma,2024-09-03 00:05:52+05:30,"Gunmarhdhar in Loidhar village is a picturesque settlement at an altitude of 1,510 metres off National Highway 244, which connects Kishtwar in Jammu division to Anantnag in Kashmir. The primary occupation of the 400-odd families is maize farming. So infrequent is travel between Kishtwar town and Loidhar village that a state transport bus service started after armless archer Sheetal Devi won two gold medals at the Hangzhou Asian Games has been terminated for lack of passengers.

Posters giving details of three wanted terrorists appear along the road from Kishtwar to Loidhar, which also sees movement of Indian army convoys. But the road, after exiting the highway leads to the back of beyond; serene and beautiful with a view of Sinthan Pass is Gunmarhdhar, the place Sheetal calls home. The last half-kilometer is a kucha road.

The archer’s videos have gone viral and she had already made waves before winning the Paris Paralympics bronze in the mixed team event with Rakesh Kumar. She has featured in The New York Times, the BBC and other major news outlets around the world. Celebrities have been posting videos of her on social media.

On Monday, Sheetal and Rakesh prevailed 156-155 in the bronze-medal contest against Italy’s Eleonora Sarti and Matteo Bonacina.

Back home in Gunmarhdhar, Sheetal’s father Mann Singh, who has been looking forward to his daughter winning a Paralympic medal, says she has once again put their village on the world’s sporting map.

“Here at our village and around this place, Sinthan Pass is most famous. Sheetal has given a new identity to this village. Her medal is our biggest treasure,” Singh told The Indian Express.

Sheetal has also uplifted the family. Her father once worked as a daily labourer, chipping down stones and transporting them. Now, Singh and Roop Chand, Sheetal’s grandfather who is 88, have been supervising the construction of their new two-room house. Sheetal is paying for the construction using cash awards she had won. “The house is a gift from Sheetal,” Singh says.

When Sheetal was born with Phocomelia, which results in under-developed limbs, Singh and his wife Shakti Devi didn’t let it affect them. They are proud that Sheetal too has surmounted all the odds.

“Just like her name, she has always remained calm,” Singh said.

The family has been in Gunmarhdhar for three generations. They own nearly half an acre of land on which maize and vegetables are grown. “Whatever I could do to support the family, I did. I worked as a labourer to make ends meet and still do occasional stone work,” Singh added.

Pride of the region

Sheetal’s former teacher at the Government Secondary School in Watnadhar, Sandeep Kumar Rathore is also excited about her feat. The school is a 20-minute walk from her home. Sheetal had enrolled there in 2012.

“I had joined the primary school as a new recruit and had met Sheetal parents at a marriage ceremony. When I asked them about sending their daughter to the school, they were a bit hesitant. But then I told them that she would be able to cope. She could write alphabets using her feet and I knew at that time that this girl would be as confident as anybody,” Kumar said.

Rakesh Dogra, the principal of Mughal Maidan Higher secondary school, where Sheetal studies, says students see her as an inspiration. “Maybe the Jammu and Kashmir education department will introduce a new chapter about Sheetal’s life in the curriculum to inspire the youth,” Rathore said.

Basheer Ahmad, a former sarpanch of the village, calls Sheetal the ‘pride of the village’. “Sheetal has shown the way for the village kids and now they have a role model to follow,” Ahmad said.

It was in 2021 that Indian Army’s Colonel Shishpal Singh, then posted with 11 Rashtriya Rifles, met Sheetal during a school reachout programme. He offered to help the family get Sheetal prosthetic limbs. The Major Akshay Memorial Trust in Bengaluru and Being You, an online storytelling platform, helped Sheetal and her sister Shivani enroll at the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board Sports Complex in Katra. Sheetal’s career as an archer took off.

Sheetal and Shivani started training under coaches Kuldeep Vedwan and Abhilasha. Over the last three years, Sheetal has made a mark – winning a silver at the world para championship apart from two medals at the Asian Games. “Sheetal had no idea about archery. But she was excited during the cab journey to Katra. It was like a new start. Initially, when she would shoot, her shoulder would suffer a lot of scars due to the band used for holding the bow. Later, when Kuldeep sir got the new holding device made, it made it easier. Now more than 20 trainees here want to become like Sheetal,” Shivani said.

In Gunmarhdhar, there is hope that the medal will bring change. A refurbishment of the primary school, construction of a health centre, the commencement of the bus service that was stopped, and paving of the road to Sheetal’s home. Her family is waiting for the day she returns to the village. “Hopefully, Sheetal’s medal will bring positive change for the people here,” Singh said."
"A new metro turn: After 2 years, Chandigarh admin says ‘will conduct viability study’ first",Hina Rohtaki,2024-09-03 00:02:26+05:30,"Meetings after meetings in the last two years were convened to finalise the Metro project in the Tricity. The RITES agency had even prepared an alternative analysis report which had chalked out minute details recommending a two-coach metro for the city at a cost of Rs 24,000 crore.

But now after two years, the administration says that it will conduct a viability study of the Metro first.

At a meeting of Unified Metro Transportation Authority (UMTA) that was attended by over 23 members, including officers from neighbouring states, UT Administrator Gulab Chand Kataria Monday suggested that before going ahead with the project, the authorities should check the viability of the project first.

While residents were hoping that very soon the tentative date of commencement of work would be informed, the project is likely to see delay.

A senior officer of the Chandigarh Administration who attended the meeting said that they have been asked to form a committee and check viability of the project first by the Administrator. “It was suggested to conduct a viability study first — whether it is feasible or not. A committee shall be constituted and they will also study the feasibility in other cities of the country,” the officer said.

The meeting that was chaired by the administrator also had in presence Haryana Chief Secretary T V S N Prasad and Punjab Chief Secretary Anurag Verma among others.

This was the third meeting of the Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) which was convened to discuss the ‘Alternative Analysis Report’ and ‘Geotechnical Investigations Report’ for MRTS in Chandigarh Tricity.

The Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) is a unified platform to handle overall mobility issues of Tricity and ensure coordination among various stakeholders, institutions and implementation of this mobility plan to improve the traffic situation in the city.

Before the administrator could give his opinion, a detailed presentation was first given on a metro train network spanning approximately 154.5 km in two phases for the Tricity.

Kataria then asked the officers to examine the financial and economic viability of the metro project for similar-sized cities where metro is already operational.

Under phase-I which was proposed to be completed by 2032, a stretch of 85.65 km route had been proposed (both overground and underground) in Tricity with 16.5 km underground route in heritage sectors of Chandigarh.

As per the alternative analysis report prepared by project consultant-RITES, two-coach metro has been found as most viable MRT system for Tricity.

Trees that were planned to be axed

Planning had been done at such a stage that the AAR report had even estimated the trees that were to be axed for the metro project. Around 3,376 trees were to be axed for the two-coach metro project in the Tricity. This was submitted in the alternative analysis report submitted for the metro project.

According to the details in the 165-page report, it was mentioned that “trees along the project corridors are to be removed during implementation of the project” and “the number of trees to be removed for metro system is 3376”. This was mentioned in the category of environmental effects while analysing the same.

Corridors that were planned

In Corridor 1, which is Paroul, New Chandigarh to Sector 28, Panchkula, this corridor starts from Paroul, New Chandigarh and runs along Kurali-Chandigarh Road, Madhya Marg, Railway Station Road, Manimajra, Maheshpur Road, Nada Sahib Road, Amartex Road, Sector 20 Road, Panchkula extension and terminates at Sector 28, Panchkula.

Corridor 2 has been suggested from Sukhna Lake to Sector 20/21, Panchkula. This corridor starts from Sukhna Lake and runs along Uttar Marg, Jan Marg, Udyog Path, Himalaya Marg, Airport Road, Aerocity Road, NH-7, NH-5 and terminates at Sector 20/21, Panchkula. The length of the corridor is 34.40 km.

Corridor 3 has been suggested from Transport Chowk to Grain Market Chowk. The corridor starts from Transport Chowk and runs along Purav Marg and Vikas Marg and terminates at Grain Market, Sector 39, Chandigarh.

About 26.3 lakh motorised internal trips are being made within the city by various modes, it was observed in the traffic study.

2-Coach Metro

The report had stated that only metro (two-coach) systems will continue to cater to the peak hour passenger demand much beyond 2056 attributed to its higher carrying capacity."

Seville residents protest over deadly West Nile virus outbreak,Unknown,2024-09-02 23:33:39+05:30,"Residents in Seville have organised a protest to demand stronger action against the West Nile virus, which has claimed five lives in the southern Spanish province this summer.

The virus spreads to humans when mosquitoes bite infected birds and then subsequently bite people.

The Lower Guadalquivir Valley area near Seville has been the epicenter of all 61 registered cases, including the deaths. This year's outbreak is exceptionally severe, ranking as the second-highest incidence after 2020, which reported 76 cases and eight fatalities, the BBC report said.

A protest is set to take place in Isla Mayor, Seville, on Monday evening to demand greater action against the Nile Virus.

The Fight against the Nile Virus platform is leading the event, urging authorities to intensify their efforts to contain the virus.

In response, the Andalusian regional government has appealed for calm and vowed to strengthen cooperation between provinces and municipalities to combat the outbreak.

The relatives of Granada Romero Ruiz, an 86-year-old woman who succumbed to the Nile Virus this summer, have voiced their outrage and frustration to local officials.

They hold the authorities accountable for not fumigating nearby rice fields, which they believe played a role in the virus's transmission.

In a scathing letter, the family criticized the officials for their inaction, stating that this tragic loss of life could have been prevented if they had shown the necessary responsibility and compassion from their positions of power.

Modesto González, the mayor of Coría del Río—where three of the summer’s fatalities occurred—has urged the central government to work with local authorities to implement more drastic measures.

He warned that Andalusian families now experience “enormous worry during the summer months,” stressing that this issue “goes way beyond the local area and no more time can be wasted because the lives of people are at risk.""

The Guadalquivir Valley's vast marshes and rice fields provide an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes, which transmit the West Nile virus from birds to humans and other mammals.

Jordi Figuerola, a researcher at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and the Doñana Biological Station, attributes the surge in virus circulation this year to a mild winter and wet spring.

Figuerola warns that the virus's spread is likely to continue, emphasizing the need for improved collaboration between governments and farmers to ensure efficient fumigation of rice fields and mitigate the outbreak.

The western Spanish region of Extremadura has reported 17 cases of West Nile virus, with the majority experiencing mild or no symptoms.

However, approximately 20% of cases may develop more severe symptoms, including headaches, high fever, and skin eruptions.

In rare instances, the virus can be fatal, especially among the elderly, affecting less than 5% of cases. To combat the outbreak, experts suggest a three-pronged approach: removing standing water to prevent mosquito breeding, applying eco-friendly larvicides, and educating the public on personal protection measures to minimize the risk of infection.

2 garment businessmen booked for ‘abetting suicide’ of contractor: police,Cdata,2024-09-02 23:19:31+05:30,"According to the complaint, the accused had been supplying raw materials (linen) to Sonkar for the past 10 years. Sonkar would then manufacture ready-made garments, primarily pants, from the materials provided. (File Photo)

Two garment businessmen in Mumbai were booked for abetment to suicide after a contractor, who had been working for them, allegedly died by suicide in May 2024, police said Monday.

The duo was charged after a purported video recorded by contractor before his death surfaced. In the video, the contractor, Narendra Sonkar, can be seen stating that the two accused brothers, Chirag Savla and Ketan Savla, owed him approximately Rs 25 lakh for completed orders. He claimed that their refusal to pay these dues had caused him severe financial crisis, which forced him to take the extreme step.

According to police, Sonkar allegedly died by suicide in May by hanging himself in his factory. Before his death, Sonkar had sent the video to his sent friend, who showed it to Sonkar’s wife several days later, police said. However, she was initially too intimidated to file a police complaint, as the Savla brothers had allegedly threatened her, police said. With the support of Sonkar’s friends and family, she finally filed a complaint at the Kandivali police station last week. Advertisement According to the complaint, the accused had been supplying raw materials (linen) to Sonkar for the past 10 years. Sonkar would then manufacture ready-made garments, primarily pants, from the materials provided. Sonkar’s wife alleged that the Savla brothers never paid Sonkar the full amount for any order. She further claimed that the two businessmen refused to pay the money to him and instead accused the Sonkars of owing money to them. Based on this complaint, the Kandivali police registered a case against the two accused under sections 306 (abetment to suicide), 504 (intentional insult), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, a police officer said. Dyaneshwar Granore, senior inspector of Kandivali police station said, “After verifying allegations and analysing order documents and bank transactions, preliminary inquiry revealed that the two accused businessmen owed more than Rs 25 lakh to the deceased. Hence, we have registered a case against the two and are further investigating the matter.”

GMLR project cost to go up by Rs 247 crore as BMC is set to realign twin tunnels,Nayonika Bose,2024-09-02 23:10:37+05:30,"Amid objections raised by locals residing in hamlets tucked within Aarey’s Film City, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is set to realign the 4.7 km twin tunnels of the ambitious Goregaon-Mulund Link Road project (GMLR) by 600 metres, escalating the cost of the project by Rs 247 crore. The stark jump in the tunnel project cost–which had been pegged at Rs 6,301 crore–has drawn criticism from the opposition.

A significant part of the ambitious GMLR project, the proposed twin tunnels will pass beneath the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, covering a complex topography of hillocks, forest and farmlands. However, in what had prompted the BMC to mull over the realignment of the current proposals, the tribals in the Habale pada and Nagarmudi pada within Film City, which were set to be affected by the construction of the tunnels, had raised concerns over the proposed work and its impact on their livelihoods.

Seeking to surpass the farmlands, the civic body has now charted plans to realign the tunnels by launching the tunnels 600 metres away from the originally proposed spot in Habale pada. According to a senior civic official, the BMC is also slated to get the proposed realignment vetted by experts from the IIT.

Speaking to The Indian Express, a BMC official said, “To commence work on the construction, we are going to launch the tunnels using the tunnel boring machine (TBM). However, the Adivasis in the area had raised objections over the original location. Therefore, we are now planning to launch the tunnels 600 metres ahead, resulting in the realignment. Since the area is situated within film city, we have also taken permission from them. Besides this, we will also have the proposal for realignment vetted by the IIT.”

Owing to the realignment of the tunnels, the cost of the project has spiked by Rs 247 crore, added the official. While the original costs of the tunnel had been pegged at Rs 6,301 crore, the entire GMLR link road was slated to cost Rs 8,500 crore. However, the escalation in project cost has drawn flak from the opposition, who has demanded the civic body to exercise caution.

Taking to social media, Ravi Raja, former Congress corporator wrote, “The tunnels will be realigned by 600 metres, but as expected, the cost has increased significantly. The cost has been revised upward by ₹250 crore, which is difficult to justify. Additionally, the company Singla Pvt Ltd, which has been awarded the contract to build the flyovers on this road, has a tainted past.”

“Provisions should be added to the contract stating that unless the company’s work is stringently checked by reputed external agencies like IIT, a considerable amount of money will not be released,” he added.

Meanwhile, according to officials, the TBM machine will be assembled in the vicinity with the launching of tunnels slated to commence in April 2025. While the overall length of the GMLR connecting Goregaon in the western suburbs with Mulund in the eastern suburbs will be around 12.2 km, the tunnels will be 4.7 km long and will be completed in the third phase of the project.

Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had performed the Bhoomipujan of tunnel work in July. Meanwhile, BMC has set a deadline of October 2028 for the completion of the twin tunnels."
Karnataka HC indicates it is debatable whether land grant for wife is act of corruption by CM Siddaramaiah,Cdata,2024-09-02 23:03:48+05:30,"The Karnataka High Court in oral observations in the course of a hearing in a petition filed by Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah against the approval granted by the Governor to three private persons to file cases of corruption over a 2021 land grant to the CM’s wife has indicated that it is debatable whether the land grant can be linked to the CM himself.

“In this case, relatable is quite debatable. We will see,” a single-judge bench of the Karnataka High Court observed on Monday in an oral intervention during arguments on behalf of Snehamayi Krishna – one of three private complainants of corruption against the Karnataka CM.

The judge made the observation after the special counsel for the complainant told the Court that Section 17 A of the Prevention of Corruption Act which requires the approval of the Governor for the start of a probe against the CM is “relatable to the decision” by the CM.

“Since relatable is debatable this is why an inquiry is needed,” the senior counsel for Snehamayi Krishna argued. “At the stage of application of mind for 17 A there is no material which is available which can point in one or the other direction. It is a matter where there is a needle of suspicion,” senior counsel K G Raghavan argued.

“It is a needle of suspicion pointing at a particular act of a particular person. The needle of suspicion cannot also be in thin air. There should be something. We will see if there is something. Whether it is relatable or not,” Justice M Nagaprasanna remarked.

Karnataka Governor Thawarchand Gehlot accorded sanction on August 16 to three private complainants to file cases in court seeking a probe against Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah over a 2021 allotment of 14 housing sites in Mysuru to Siddaramaiah’s wife (when the BJP was in power) in exchange for 3.16 acre of land acquired from her by Mysuru authorities.

“I hereby accord sanction against Chief Minister Sri Siddaramaiah under Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and Section 218 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 for the commission of the alleged offences as mentioned in the petitions,” the Karnataka Governor said in a communique dated August 16 that was released August 17.

The three private complainants – T J Abraham, Snehamayi Krishna, and Pradeep Kumar – who are anti-corruption activists approached the Governor in July for sanction to file private court complaints against the Karnataka CM for investigations into land allotments to the CM’s wife.

The activists have alleged corruption in the acquisition of 3.16 acres of land in the Kesare village of Mysuru in 2004 by Siddaramaiah’s brother-in-law B M Mallikarjun – who gifted the land in 2010 to Siddaramaiah’s wife Parvathi B M – and the subsequent exchange of the land in 2021 for 14 housing sites by the Mysore Urban Development Authority under a 50:50 scheme (where land equivalent to half the acquired land is allotted in a developed area).

The senior counsel for Snehamayi Krishna argued on Monday that the key relatable link to Siddaramaiah’s role in the decision-making process that led to the eventual allotment of 14 housing sites to his wife during the tenure of the BJP in 2021 was a government resolution of 2017 – when Siddaramaiah was the CM – for allotment of housing sites as land compensation.

“Resolution of 2017 is part of a chain of events,” the senior counsel argued. The question is not whether he played a role in 2022 but whether he played a role in 2017 as the CM, he said.

During the arguments on Monday, Justice Nagaprasanna reiterated that the requirements under Section 17A do not mandate that only a police officer can seek approval for initiating an inquiry against a public servant.

“This I straight away dispelled for the simple reason that no police officer can begin an investigation unless there is an approval and this does not mean that only a police officer can seek approval,” the judge observed.

The counsel for RTI activist Krishna argued that Section 7C of the Prevention of Corruption Act demands high morality from a public servant and attempting to do an improper act is in itself an act of corruption.

The hearing was later adjourned to September 9 for the Karnataka advocate general to place his arguments.

Solicitor General argued for Governor

Previously on August 31, Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta argued on behalf of the Karnataka Governor and said it was not necessary for the Governor to issue a show cause notice over requests for sanction.

Issuing a notice to CM Siddaramaiah in one complaint and not issuing in two others where sanction has been given does not render the sanction process illegal, Mehta argued.

Justice Nagaprasanna observed during the arguments that anyone can initiate the process of law under the Prevention of Corruption Act – even a private individual – and it does not have to be done by a police officer alone. However, the police can begin a probe only with a prior sanction, he observed.

The bench also indicated that the advice of the Council of Ministers is not required to be considered for the Governor to decide on granting sanction for the prosecution of a CM. In cases of prosecution of a CM, the Governor must act independently and apply his mind for granting sanction as laid down by Supreme Court orders, it was iterated.

Arguments for Siddaramaiah

Beginning the arguments in the case on August 19, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, the senior counsel for Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah, argued that under Section 17 A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, sanction for investigation has to be sought by a police officer or investigation agency.

He pointed out that one of the private persons who approached the Governor for sanction said in a statement of objection that sanction was not necessary at this stage. Singhvi argued that the move of the Governor to give sanction at a stage when sanction was not required amounts to “non-application of mind”.

Singhvi argued that the current sanction of the Governor must go since there was no need for sanction as admitted by the complainant.

On August 19, the HC had stated that a special court “should defer all proceedings and not precipitate matter in any way with regard to the impugned sanction.” The HC has subsequently extended the order of August 19.

The Siddaramaiah government stopped the 50:50 scheme of MUDA in March 2023 after complaints surfaced regarding the misuse of the scheme that was started during the BJP tenure in 2020, the HC was informed on Monday.

In the MUDA scam, the Karnataka Government has constituted two separate probes by a one-man judicial commission headed by former Karnataka HC judge P N Desai and a second by IAS officer Venkatachalapathy.

The Karnataka Governor while granting sanction for filing of complaints in a court against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has stated that the ordering of two separate probes by the Congress government into the MUDA scam raises suspicion of wrongdoing.

“Further, the constituting of a committee under an IAS officer and immediately constituting one more committee under a retired Judge of the High Court and the Government’s own acceptance that there is a potential big ticket scam in the allotment of sites by MUDA does not inspire much confidence,” the Governor stated in his sanction order of August 16.

“It is a well-settled legal principle that the person against whom allegations are made, should not be empowered to decide the course of action,” the Governor said.

“Upon perusal of the petition along with the materials in support of the allegations in the petitions and subsequent reply of Sri Siddaramaiah and the advice of the State Cabinet along with the legal opinion, it seems to me that there are two versions in relation to the same set of facts. It is very necessary that a neutral, objective and non-partisan investigation should be conducted. I am prima facie satisfied that the allegations and the supporting materials disclose commission of offences,” Gehlot stated."

Gandhi said the BJP’s actions have revealed an “anti-constitutional face,” which undermines “humanity and justice.”

In a post on X, Gandhi said, “The anti-constitutional face of the BJP, which has crushed humanity and justice under the bulldozer, has now been exposed in front of the country.” He held that the bulldozer has become a symbol of the BJP’s “unbridled power,” continuously challenging civil rights with arrogance.

“The bulldozer, which is being run to establish the ‘rule of fear’ under the guise of ‘instant justice’ often targets the households of the Bahujans and the poor,” he wrote, expressing hope that the Supreme Court will provide clear guidelines to protect citizens from what he termed the BJP’s “anti-democracy campaign.” Advertisement Also Read | ‘Bulldozer justice’: As SC talks tough, a look at how it became the go-to for some state governments Gandhi said, “We expect that the Supreme Court will issue clear guidelines on this very sensitive issue and protect the citizens from this anti-democracy campaign of the BJP governments.” “The country will be run by Baba Saheb’s Constitution, not by the whip of power,” he said.

"7 cell phones, 5 chargers, vaping device seized in sweep at Pune’ Yerwada Jail, probe on",Cdata,2024-09-02 22:47:03+05:30,"IN A sweep conducted at the Yerawada Open Prison, jail authorities recovered seven cell phones, five phone chargers, a power bank and a vaping device. An investigation by police and an internal probe has been initiated into the recoveries, said an officer in the know of the matter.

An FIR in the case was registered at Yerawada police station last week based on a complaint filed by a jailer posted at the Yerawada Open Prison. Following directions of the Superintendent of the Open Prison Anil Khamkar, a sweep was conducted on the premises of the minimum security facility on the morning of August 26, said the officer.

During the sweep, cell phones, accessories and a vaping device were recovered, some of which were abandoned in the dustbin next to the prison washroom, some were hidden behind a wall and some were found in shrubs next to a barrack of the open prison.

A total of seven cell phones—three without a SIM card and four with SIM cards—five chargers, a power bank and a battery operated vaping device were recovered. “After the recovery of the cell phones, power bank, chargers and vaping device was reported to the senior prison department officials, an FIR was registered at Yerawada police station and an internal inquiry has also been initiated. These probes will try to ascertain how these phones were obtained, by whom and who were using them,” added the officer.

Open prisons are minimum security facilities where convicted inmates are lodged after they show good behavior and signs of reform during their sentences at central prisons. The sentence served at open prisons have a key advantage — for one year served at open prison without any negative remark, an inmate gets one year of remission.

The inmates of open prisons work in open fields located next to these prisons and have least monitoring as against the maximum security facilities which have stringent monitoring, security and surveillance. Located next to maximum security Yerawada Central Prison, the Yerawada Open prison currently has 240 inmates, all serving life sentences for murders and who have shown good behavior in their stay at various central prisons in the state. A life convict has to serve a sentence ranging from 14 years to the entirety of natural life in prison, depending on the nature of the crime and several other factors.

A senior officer from the prison department said, “The prisons across the state have all been provided smart card based phone facilities, video calling facilities through e-Mulakat online visitation facilities. But these facilities can be used to contact only verified contacts and these calls are monitored. The recovery of the number of cell phones, in spite of these facilities, suggests that they were being used for illegal activities.”

In a drive launched across key prisons in the state in April last year, 33 cellphones were recovered from six prison facilities for which 20 FIRs were registered. Of these, maximum 17 phones were seized from Yerawada prison in Pune alone.

The recovery of the 33 phones were in addition to multiple recoveries of the cell phone batteries and SIM cards, which prisons officials say, are equally ‘useful’ for an inmate when the cell phones are shared among a group of them. The officers of the prisons, where the phones were seized, also faced action for having failed to put in place adequate security measures.

Earlier this year, following recovery of several cell phones and SIM cards during one such coordinated sweep conducted inside the high security Kolhapur Central Prison, two prison officers and nine prison guards were dismissed from service by the Maharashtra prison department in Pune."
Mumbai Coastal Road set to be partially linked with Bandra Worli Sea Link this month,Cdata,2024-09-02 22:42:32+05:30,"The “bow-string” arch bridge which is the final link between the Mumbai Coastal Road and Bandra Worli Sea Link (BWSL) is set to be partially opened by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) this month. Mumbai’s municipal commissioner and state-appointed administrator Bhushan Gagrani confirmed this development with The Indian Express on Monday.

After this bridge is opened, vehicles will be able to travel between Nariman Point and Bandra by using the sea link. At present, the coastal road is operational only till Worli. “One of the two arms of the arch bridge is almost ready for vehicular movement. Therefore, we are anticipating opening it for vehicles around or after September 10. At present, ancillary works like painting the signages and illuminating the structure are ongoing,” said a civic official.

The officials maintained that after opening this bridge, north-bound vehicles travelling from Nariman Point can directly enter the Sea Link and exit at Bandra. However, the entry point for south-bound vehicles will remain the same at Worli. “Vehicles travelling towards north can directly avail the sea-link without exiting from the Worli interchange. Meanwhile, the point of entry for the south-bound vehicles traveling towards Nariman Point remains unchanged from Worli and Haji Ali,” the official said. Advertisement Earlier, the BMC was supposed to open this bridge partially for vehicular movement from July end. However, owing to the heavy spell of rainfall the maximum city witnessed last month, the civic authorities postponed the deadline owing to high tidal waves since the civil works for this bridge was taken up from the Arabian Sea. However, civic officials said that owing to frequent dry spells during July, the civil works were expedited. The arch bridges weigh around 4,000 metric tonnes (MT) and have an average length of 140 meters. At present, the coastal road is operational between 7 am and 11 pm on weekdays.

‘Revolutionaries will not bow down to the dictator’s tyranny’: AAP slams BJP after Delhi MLA Amanatullah Khan’s arrest,Cdata,2024-09-02 22:35:30+05:30,"Hours after Okhla MLA Amanatullah Khan was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with a money laundering case Monday, the Aam Aam Party (AAP) hit out at the BJP-led Centre and said “revolutionaries will not bow down to the dictator’s tyranny”.

It alleged that the motive behind Khan’s arrest was to stop him from campaigning in his constituency for the Delhi Assembly polls next year. “… The more the BJP and its agencies try to suppress us, the more vocal our voices will be,” it added.

Deputy CM Manish Sisodia in a post on X said, “This is the only job left for ED. Suppress every voice raised against the BJP. Break it. Arrest and put in jail those who do not break or get suppressed.” Advertisement AAP Rajya Sabha MP and senior leader Sanjay Singh accused the Centre of “goondagardi” (rowdyism) and said, “Khan’s arrest will prove costly for the BJP. It will lose badly in Delhi… the ED arrested him without any evidence…” Health Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj said: “The central government’s investigating agency has been after Khan for the last eight years. When they found nothing, they filed a case against him under the PMLA as it would take months for him to get bail… This arrest is nothing but a conspiracy hatched by the BJP to arrest AAP leaders before polls.” Hitting back at the AAP, Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said: “If the investigative agency is doing its job, why are AAP leaders so anxious? If you are right, the truth will come out. The AAP has a long list of criminals and corrupt individuals, and whenever action is taken against them, they start making noise.

Ananya Panday was not okay saying ‘a lot of things’ in Liger: ‘It is my duty and responsibility as a woman to…’,Cdata,2024-09-02 22:21:02+05:30,"Unlike many star kids in Bollywood, Ananya Panday has proven herself to be a worthy addition to the industry through her impressive performances, the most recent one being in Kho Gaye Hum Kahan (2023). While her highly anticipated thriller film CTRL, directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, is in post-production and expected to release in October, Panday is currently busy promoting her debut streaming series, the comedy-drama Call Me Bae.

Although most of her films, including her debut Student of the Year 2, have made some kind of impact at the box office and/or on the audiences, one project that turned out to be a significant setback for her was director Puri Jagannadh’s sports action drama Liger (2022), which also starred Vijay Deverakonda. Liger, shot in both Hindi and Telugu simultaneously, marked Deverakonda’s entry into Bollywood and Panday’s into Tollywood.

Produced on a hefty budget of over Rs 100 crore, the film only managed to earn Rs 56.18 crore worldwide, as reported by industry tracker Sacnilk, making it a major disaster. The film received major criticism not only for its poor execution and a lack of freshness in its narrative but also for its misogynistic tones.

Recently, Ananya Panday opened up about the movie, stating that she had told the filmmakers she was not “okay” with saying a lot of the things her character says in the film. “The way we are exposed to things now, where you feel like it’s on your phone but its also so much more… I don’t know how to label it. It’s bad out there. Being a young, Gen-Z person the only thing I can do is use my voice for what is important. I feel like everyone needs to stand for something, you don’t need to stand for everything but you can stand for something. That’s what I try to do. Personally, for me, women’s safety and the state of that in our country is very important to speak about and I do voice my opinion a lot,” she said during a chat with Sucharita Tyagi.

“Whenever I am reading a script I have this red flag thing going on in my mind like, ‘No Gen-Z person speaks like this.’ This is not okay. It is my duty and responsibility as a woman to be that face and say this is not correct. If I say that people are going to think that it is okay. For example, in Liger, there were a lot of things in that script where I was like, ‘Listen I am not okay saying this. As a woman, this is not correct.’ They actually did make those changes and I am really happy that I did voice my opinion at that time,” she added.

Call Me Bae is set to premiere on Amazon Prime Video on Friday (September 6). In addition to Ananya Panday, the series also features Vir Das, Gurfateh Pirzada, Varun Sood and Vihaan Samat in key roles. The eight-part show, created by Ishita Moitra, is directed by Colin D’Cunha."
Central govt asks Maharashtra to probe ‘violations’ in CIDCO projects under PMAY,Siddhant Konduskar,2024-09-02 22:20:57+05:30,"The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) signed the directive and emphasised that States and Union Territories are responsible for enforcing Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) provisions under the Environment Protection Act, 1986.

The central government has directed the Maharashtra Government to investigate alleged environmental violations in the execution of the Prime Minister Awas Yojana (PMAY) by the City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) in Navi Mumbai.

Environmentalists have raised concerns that the housing projects being developed by the CIDCO of Maharashtra under the Prime Minister’s Awas Yojana (PMAY) in Mansarovar and Kharghar in Navi Mumbai, might be violating environmental regulations by encroaching on protected mangrove buffer zones.

The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) signed the directive and emphasised that States and Union Territories are responsible for enforcing Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) provisions under the Environment Protection Act, 1986.

Addressing a news conference, the Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council said Patil had declared availing Rs 4 crore loan from Bagmane Developers in the affidavit he filed for the 2023 Assembly elections. Two of the directors of Bagmane Developers – Raja Bagmane and Dandiganahalli Venkataramanappa Ramakrishna – were also directors in another firm called Vaigai Investments Private Limited. Vaigai was allotted a 7.8-acre civic amenities site by the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) at Hitech Defence and Aerospace Park after Patil became minister, the BJP leader claimed highlighting a few documents.

A firm linked to the minister’s son was also allotted industrial land, he alleged. Advertisement Narayanaswamy’s salvo came in response to Patil’s remarks last week wherein he had claimed that the BJP leader had acquired a two-acre KIADB plot in the Hebbal Industrial Area of Mysuru 18 years ago but failed to establish any industrial unit there. Earlier, Patil had mounted a defence of the allocation of a KIADB site to Siddhartha Vihar Trust run by AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge’s family members, including Karnataka minister Priyank Kharge. Responding to Narayanaswamy’s allegations made earlier in the day, Patil said his family had a relationship with Bagmane Tech Park for three decades. “Companies such as Bagmane, Prestige, Brigade Group, Embassy, and Mantri have contributed to the growth of Bengaluru.

IC-814 series row: Ministry tells Netflix to keep religious sentiments in mind,Divya A,2024-09-02 21:57:09+05:30,"The Union Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (I&B) Monday summoned Netflix representatives after the series IC-814: The Kandahar Hijack sparked a controversy over “Hindu names” used as aliases by the Pakistani terrorists involved in the 1999 hijacking.

The series, which started streaming on August 29, shows the five hijackers of the Indian Airlines flight addressing each other using code names — Chief, Doctor, Burger, Bhola and Shankar. A Home Ministry statement from January 6, 2000, available on the website of the Ministry of External Affairs, shows that these indeed were the code names used by the hijackers from the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen terror group. Many including BJP leaders have objected to the use of the aliases Shankar and Bhola.

It was conveyed to Netflix representatives that they must keep religious sentiments and sensitivities of the public in mind, sources in the I&B Ministry told The Indian Express.

While the government has no immediate plan to ban the series, officials from Netflix — including its content head — have been asked to find a way to douse the controversy, said the sources. The ministry is also likely to summon Anubhav Sinha, the maker of the series, it is learnt.

Former Union Minister and BJP leader Rajeev Chandrasekhar posted on X: “Every man and woman in India and indeed in South Asia knows that the hijack of IC-814 from Kathmandu was committed by Pakistan’s ISI-backed terrorists. Now, nobody thinks that there were some people from India who did the hijacking. So how the people have Hindu names in that movie, I don’t know. But I’m very happy that the I&B Ministry and the GoI have taken cognizance of this and have summoned Netflix.”

BJP IT Cell chief Amit Malviya said the hijackers were dreaded terrorists who acquired aliases to hide their Muslim identities. “Filmmaker Anubhav Sinha, legitimised their criminal intent, by furthering their non-Muslim names. Decades later, people will think Hindus hijacked IC-814,” he posted on X.

The Indian Airlines flight from Kathmandu to Delhi was hijacked on December 24, 1999 and taken to Kandahar in Afghanistan. The hijacking ended more than a week later — after negotiations, the release of three terrorists by the then BJP government and the death of one of the 179 passengers onboard.

Former Jammu & Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said it was amusing to see the people who took movies like Kashmir Files as gospel truth having a “meltdown” about the way the events of IC-814 are depicted. “Now suddenly they want accuracy and nuance packaged in the script,” Abdullah said on X.

Shiv Sena-UBT leader Priyanka Chaturvedi said the series was a reminder of the then BJP government’s “massive failure” then. “It reminds the nation how the intelligence and government agencies were caught off guard. Much like the Kargil war too,” said the Rajya Sabha member.

Meanwhile, actor and BJP MP Kangana Ranaut, whose film Emergency is yet to get a clearance from the Central Board of Film Certification, said Monday: “Censorship is only for some of us, who don’t want tukde (pieces) of this nation.”"
"India, Singapore likely to sign pacts on semiconductors, health; Brunei to be part of defence group",Cdata,2024-09-02 21:56:36+05:30,"As Prime Minister Narendra Modi is headed to Brunei and Singapore on Tuesday, India and Singapore are looking at a number of “new, forward-looking futuristic areas of cooperation” in semiconductors, digitisation, skill, health, advance manufacturing and connectivity, and are likely to sign pacts in these areas, officials said on Monday.

PM Modi is slated to visit Singapore on September 4-5 at the invitation of his Singaporean counterpart Lawrence Wong.

Before that, he is scheduled to visit Brunei on September 3-4 at the invitation of Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah.

Secretary (East), Ministry of External Affairs, Jaideep Mazumdar, said that India and Brunei are working towards setting up a “joint working group in defence”.

Prime Minister Modi is visiting Singapore after nearly six years, he said.

“This comes at a time when a new leader is in Singapore and this is an opportune time to set the stage for the next stage of our vibrant bilateral relations,” Mazumdar said.

The Secretary (East) said India-Singapore ties have “evolved” and there is a “dynamic strategic partnership” encompassing various areas from shared history and people-to-people ties that form an important link between the two countries.

“Our trade and investment flows have shown a steady growth, we have robust defence cooperation and growing exchanges in culture and education. We have identified new anchors of our partnership under the India-Singapore ministerial roundtable framework,” he said.

Four Indian ministers participated in the recently held second India-Singapore ministerial roundtable.

During the event, the ministers from both sides discussed new thrust areas that we can identify in futuristic areas of cooperation. “A number of new, forward-looking futuristic areas of cooperation were identified in digitisation, sustainability skill, health, advanced manufacturing and connectivity, and we are likely to exchange a number of MoUs during the forthcoming visit of the prime minister,” he said.

“We also expect the visit (to Singapore) to give thrust to the cooperation in the field of semiconductors,” the top official of the MEA said.

“India-Singapore relations are poised for an even bigger takeoff, than what it has been in the last 10-15 years or so. That is because, we have gone to the next level of identifying areas of bilateral cooperation whether it be in food security, renewables, green hydrogen and semiconductors. These are areas where we have great complementarities,” said Mazumdar.

For Singapore, India presents tremendous opportunities and for India, Singapore presents many options, whether it is value chain, digital technology, and semiconductors, he added.

Singapore is India’s largest trade partner in the ASEAN bloc and the country is a leading source of foreign direct investment.

It is India’s sixth largest trade partner worldwide and was the largest source of FDI during the last financial year valued at USD 11.77 billion, he said.

“The visit will also take place in light of our 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations which we are celebrating in 2025, and the 10th year of our strategic partnership with Singapore,” he added.

Modi’s visit to Brunei will be the first bilateral visit of an Indian Prime Minister to that country. It will also mark 40 years of diplomatic ties between India and Brunei.

“Brunei is an important partner in India’s ‘Act East’ Policy and its vision for the Indo-Pacific. And, as we mark a decade of our ‘Act East’ policy, the visit assumes additional significance,” the MEA official said.

Brunei had been “our country coordinator in ASEAN” from 2012-2015, and played a key role in “our further engagement with ASEAN and continues to do so today”.

“We have received a valuable contribution from Brunei in our space programme. We have three MoUs with Brunei in this area. We have established a telemetry tracking and command station in Brunei in 2000 and this tracks and monitors all our eastward launches of satellites and launch vehicles,” Mazumdar said."
21-year-old man dies by suicide after killing teenage girl in North Tripura,Debraj Deb,2024-09-02 21:55:50+05:30,"A 21-year-old man on Monday died by suicide after allegedly killing a teenage girl in North Tripura’s Kanchanpur village, officials said.

The man has been identified as Kartik Debnath, a college student. Debnath was allegedly in a romantic relationship with the 16-year-old girl, who was a secondary level student at a local school.

“We have registered a murder case. The reason of the murder is not yet known. We are investigating”, Bhanupada Chakraborty, Superintendent of Police for the North Tripura district, said.

According to the police, the teenager was on her way to the school when Debnath attacked her with a kitchen knife and stabbed her repeatedly, later taking his own life with the weapon.

Indian football: New head coach Manolo Marquez starts rebuilding process after failure to progress in World Cup qualifying,Shashank Nair,2024-09-02 21:39:09+05:30,"Manolo Marquez would be the first to say that his debut as manager of the Indian national football team could have come under better circumstances. Just two training sessions with his 26-man squad before his first selected 11 take the pitch at the Gachibowli Stadium in Hyderabad is not an ideal situation.

The two games against Mauritius and Syria start a tricky climb for India – these matches will be the first of a series of friendlies until March 2025 – when the team will attempt to make it to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. In an alternate universe, this period should have seen India’s first foray into the third round of the World Cup qualifiers, but two abysmal results against Afghanistan led to former coach Igor Stimac’s ouster and a fresh start under Marquez, who doubles up as Indian Super League (ISL) club FC Goa’s coach as well as the India boss.

“The first FIFA window now is a little tricky because we are still in pre-season. Some clubs played with their reserve teams in the Durand Cup. We don’t exactly know the physical situation of all the players. That won’t happen in the next FIFA windows because the ISL will be ongoing. But again, I think this is not an excuse. We are ready for tomorrow,” the Spaniard said.

“In two training sessions, it’s difficult to change a lot of things. We have players from seven or eight different teams. It’s difficult because every team plays a different style. But finally, we will enter the pitch with 11 players and try to play a good game.”

Tough road ahead

The 55-year-old finds himself in an unenviable position. The national team coach’s reach in terms of improving players is quite restricted, due to the inadequate time they get to spend with the players. In that sense, not much will change for Marquez, from what was the situation for Stimac. Both had to contend with a set of professionals who are not near Asian standards when it comes to physicality, the speed with which they pass, and their tactical acumen. The Indian team that played at the AFC Asian Cup at the start of the year, and the one that lost at home to Afghanistan, were out of their depth in matches that actually mattered.

In a country that has idolised IM Vijayan, Bhaichung Bhutia and the recently-retired Sunil Chhetri, finding someone to take on the mantle of goalscorer has been tough.

(Express photo)

How much Marquez can work on that aspect of Indian football is questionable. There is an argument to be made that as an ISL coach, he continues to have a better chance of developing Indian players, as opposed to being in a position that allows the coach to do so only for a couple of months a year, as would have been the case if he were the full-time India handler.

Marquez will also have the task of finding the next Indian striker. In a country that has idolised IM Vijayan, Bhaichung Bhutia and the recently-retired Sunil Chhetri, finding someone to take on the mantle of goalscorer has been tough. The problem once again trickles down to the top league in India that rarely allows local players to play in crucial positions – be it striker, central midfielder or central defenders. Finding young Indian players enough game time in the league has been a major failing that has directly resulted in the already poor standards of the national team going down further.

In a previous media interaction, Marquez had indicated that India’s lack of goals could be addressed by creating a team that scores goals, rather than finding an individual striker who may or may not live up to the position. In that sense, these two games give India a chance to start building towards a style of play that can coexist with their domestic circumstances.

Marquez already seems prepared for the inevitability of an undercooked squad. In his press conference ahead of the game against Mauritius, he admitted that the true reflection of the team won’t emerge from these two games.

“Whatever result we get, it won’t be the real situation of the national team,” said Marquez, ahead of a game against an opponent ranked 179th in the world. Mauritius and India last faced each other in 2017 in the same friendly tournament where the home team won 2-1.

Four breakthroughs that are changing our understanding of dreams,Cdata,2024-09-02 21:30:40+05:30,"People have pondered whether dreams have a purpose throughout human history. Modern scientists are fascinated with this question too.

For a long time the science of dreams has oscillated between fringe research and the mainstream. But creative study designs and new technology are transforming it into an exciting and serious research niche.

Here are four recent breakthroughs that may pave the way for a greater understanding of dreaming.

Lucid dreams

In 2021 an international study showed that two-way communication between a lucid dreamer and a researcher in the lab was possible. In 2024, another study built on this by training lucid dreamers to control a virtual car from within their dreams.

The 12 dreamers in the experiment made slight muscle twitches, which sent a signal to a computer to make the virtual vehicle move forwards or turn. Signals were sent back to the dreamer to inform them of obstacles to try and avoid. Some could move the car well, but others, no matter how hard they tried, could not.

While fascinating, it is still unknown how such technology could be used in everyday life. And the small sample of this study, in part owing to the rarity of skilled lucid dreamers, limit the conclusions we can take from it. But the findings suggest that it may be possible (at least with practice) for some people to make decisions from inside a dream and communicate them to the outside world.

Why do we dream?

Sleep and dreams researcher Mark Blagrove from Swansea University thinks dreams were meant to be shared socially and evolved in humans to enhance emotional intelligence and empathy.

Since 2016, Blagrove has collaborated with artist Julia Lockheart in a dream discussion and illustration group. An audience member is invited to share a recent dream. Blagrove leads the discussion, while Lockheart sketches an interpretation of the dream onto the pages of Sigmund Freud’s book The Interpretation of Dreams.

His 2019 research paper showed that discussing a dream in this way can lead to increased empathy between dream sharer and listeners. Blagrove argues this could have been valuable to ancestral survival in forming significant connections with others.

Other theories about why we dream have begun to emerge in recent years too, and some were discussed at a panel in June 2024 at the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) annual conference. For example, the embodied cognition theory of dreaming, which proposes that dreams prepare us for the cognitive actions of ordinary waking life.

It hasn’t been tested yet but shows a growing scientific interest in the adaptive purpose of dreams.

Insights from long dream series

Michael Schredl of the University of Mannheim in Germany is arguably the most prolific dream researcher today, having published hundreds of articles and books since his career began in the 1990s. He has been keeping a dream journal since the early 1980s. At the IASD conference, he gave a keynote talk analysing over 12,000 of his dreams.

Overall, the patterns seemed to support the continuity hypothesis of dreaming – that our dreams are influenced by events and concerns that are happening in our waking lives.

Schredl believes he is one of the first people to look at weather patterns in dreams. He noticed a steady decline over the years of ice, snow and hail in his dreams. Interestingly, this was similar to the documented declining number of “ice days” (days when the temperature was below 0°C for 24 hours) in Germany since he has been keeping a dream journal. He joked that perhaps the global warming effects are showing up in dreams too, but this could also be influenced by waking concerns about such things.

Another interesting pattern was references to money in dreams. When the Deutsche Mark was the prevailing currency, it occasionally showed up in his dreams over the years, but when the

German currency changed to the Euro in 2002, the number of Deutsche Mark references were replaced by references to the Euro.

Long dream series such as this are rare, but they can show how us how intertwined dream content is with our waking lives.

Dream recall

Some people are better at remembering their dreams than others, recalling dreams more frequently and in more detail. For a long time, researchers have tried to determine the reasons and mechanisms for this difference. They’ve looked into factors including personality and attitude towards dreams, general memory ability, and the small physiological signals that happen during certain sleep stages. So far, one of the most consistent predictors of more frequent dream recall has been a positive attitude towards dreaming; if you think dreams are important, you’re probably more motivated to try and remember them more often.

In 2022 French researcher Salomé Blain and their colleagues investigated the role of attention in dream recall, a cognitive skill which is closely connected to memory.

While their participants’ ability to recall dreams did not seem linked to working memory – which temporarily holds information for immediate use – participants with low dream recall were better at ignoring distracting stimuli, and vice versa.

They compared low and high dream recallers in their ability to distinguish whether two melodies (which were both played in the same ear) were different, while a distracting melody was played in the opposite ear.

This suggests that people who are good at remembering dreams may be worse at filtering out irrelevant and distracting information, hence they may notice more of what’s happening in their mind while sleeping.

However, dream recall is a learnable skill. For example, keeping a dream journal can significantly improve dream recall, especially for people who already have quite low dream recollection."

In the poster, Rajinikanth can be seen examining the back of an oval golden plate, which appears to be an arm badge, bearing the number 1421 on its front.

Why BJP finds itself on unsure footing in Haryana,Varinder Bhatia,2024-09-02 21:25:01+05:30,"A subpar performance in the Lok Sabha elections, a hold-up over the candidates’ list, uncertainty over the seat from which Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini will contest, and senior leaders such as state BJP president Mohan Lal Badoli and former MP Sanjay Bhatia opting out of the October 5 Assembly elections. Battling a 10-year anti-incumbency and a rejuvenated Congress, the BJP appears to be on shaky ground in Haryana as it attempts to win power in the state for the third straight time.

With internal surveys showing that the Congress, the main Opposition party, has a clear edge going into the elections, including in areas where the BJP made significant gains in the past, the ruling party is scrambling to get its act together. A section of the party claimed that resentment against the government, especially the previous administration led by Manohar Lal Khattar, has become a major hurdle.

“The party is not yet over the shock of the Lok Sabha results. Although the party was conscious of the anti-incumbency factor — there was a last-minute change in the top leadership in the state — the leadership was confident that Prime Minister Modi’s popularity would overcome it,” said a BJP leader.

While a section of leaders said Khattar could be asked to confine himself to Karnal, from where he won the recent Lok Sabha election, others said such a move could adversely affect the party’s campaign as the “BJP always goes to polls on its governance record in a state where it is in power”. Asked one leader, “How will you seek votes if the CM of almost 10 years is kept on the sidelines?”

The delay in releasing the candidates’ list has also raised questions. Over the past 10 days, several rounds of meetings have taken place between the state unit and the central leadership, including a meeting of the Central Election Committee chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and BJP president J P Nadda.

BJP sources said the list, which was initially expected to be released over the weekend, was stuck due to disagreement over 35 of the 90 Assembly seats in the state. The party is facing a rebellion in a few of these constituencies, according to the insiders. The decision to induct four rebels from former ally Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) had also not gone down well with some in the party cadre, the insiders added.

The four are Devender Singh Babli, who defeated then state BJP president Subhash Barala in Tohana in 2019; Ram Kumar Gautam, who defeated then state Cabinet Minister Captain Abhimanyu in Narnaund; Jogi Ram Sihag who defeated the BJP’s Surender Punia in Barwala; and Anoop Dhanak who defeated the BJP’s Asha Khedar in Uklana. All these former JJP leaders are looking to contest from their constituencies, with the BJP leaders they defeated also eyeing the tickets.

Sources in central BJP, however, denied there was any confusion about tickets. “The list is almost complete. But the delay in its release is a strategic decision. We are waiting for our rivals’ moves also. We have already informed the candidates and they have started preparing,” said a leader, adding that the list was being prepared with “utmost care to not antagonise any senior leader or sections.”

“The biggest challenge for any party in the election these days is to arrest an exodus of leaders who are not happy. We have so far tried to accommodate everyone’s views and interests,” said the source.

Asked about the delay in releasing the list, Badoli said, “Suggestions from each level of the party are being collected before the high command approves the final list of candidates. It is a long list.”

Admitting that the BJP was facing anti-incumbency, a BJP leader said, “Some decisions taken during the government under Khattar saab triggered anger. The Saini government has been working to ensure that they are negated or diluted.”

He added, “Since we have to go to polls with our governance record, we have decided to highlight selective measures. For example, the party will go heavy on our ‘bina parchi bina kharchi naukri (job without recommendations or bribes)’. With the BJP focussing on its OBC support base, the Saini government’s decision to increase the annual income limit for creamy layer for employment in the OBC category from Rs 6 lakh to 8 lakh will be highlighted.”

Recent confusion over which seat CM Saini will contest from has also illustrated that the state BJP may not be entirely in sync. On the afternoon of August 28, Badoli ruled himself out of the contest and said Saini would contest from Ladwa in Kurukshetra district. Saini who currently represents Karnal told the media that Badoli might have had more information than him but he would contest from his current seat. Later that night, Saini’s representatives issued a statement saying the CM’s comments should be taken lightly as he would contest from wherever the party high command asked him to."

"Paris Paralympics: Shuttler Thulasimathi Murugesan takes silver, vindication for family of modest means",Shivani Naik,2024-09-02 21:08:53+05:30,"Thulasimathi Murugesan had a birth deformity in her left hand, which allowed only 20-30 percent extension flexion, and often left her in shooting pain when a nerve flared up. Her father, an obsessive sports lover from Kancheepuram, however refused to tell her anything was wrong with her, and instead got her used to competing in badminton alongside able-bodied children, including elder sister, Kiruttigha.

The sisters even won the Khelo India Under-19 district doubles titles in open category, until one day, in wincing pain while watching an international tournament four years ago, Thulasimathi screamed at the TV and demanded to know, “If I work so hard, why am I not good enough to play an international event?”

The sombre answer explaining her condition would jolt her awake and the clarity gave her a direction.

Having grown up in desperate poverty, where their home, a straw hut, got burnt down in a fire, and all their father’s daily wages were saved up for nutrition for the two girls, she was determined to get herself classified in para-badminton, and seriously pursue Paralympics qualification. On Monday, she won India its first women’s podium at Paris in Para badminton. The 22-year-old lost to China’s Yang Qiu Xia in straight games 21-17, 21-10 in 30 minutes in the women’s singles SU5 final, but the medal at the biggest stage was vindication of the struggles and sacrifices Thulasimathi and her family have made over the years.

Murugesan loved sport and played basketball and athletics in school, but as one of seven children, he grew up subsisting on reheated Kanji water. He loved to coach different sports, and Thulasi grew up training over the 200m-800m distance. “Thulasi was born disabled,” sister Kiruttigha says, adding “But my father never wanted her to know she’s a para-player. She was given equal training, and worked harder than everyone else. We tried the Kerala ayurveda treatments but after that my father just decided she will play sports and not dwell on the disability.”

The girls would train from 4.30 am and spend many days not knowing if a lunch tiffin would arrive by noon. “Life was tough, we would overhear our parents talking about no ration. But they ensured that when we ate, we ate nutritious food. My dad was crazy about all sports and had decided we would become great athletes,” Kiruttigha recalls.

He did odd-jobs on film sets, helped with sports coaching, guided youngsters on career pathways, and dreamt of sport for his daughters. “We always had relatives mocking him because us girls were always on the ground. We were told nothing good would come of us. So we both studied very hard. Thulasi didn’t know about her condition, but would quietly endure pain. Then we started in badminton after a strong athletic base.” she explains.

How badminton was decided as the way forward is yet another interesting tale.

“Our dad would make us play basketball one day, table tennis another, and football on the third. He would ask at the end of the day, how we liked it. We obviously enjoyed them all, including kungfu. Only when it came to badminton, Thulasi complained that it’s too difficult and strokes will take time to learn. That’s it. Father decided the toughest, most challenging sport is what we will pursue and he will coach us,” Kiruttigha says. Broken racquets of senior players were searched, to be restrung.

Hardship toughens her

Thulasi’s dedication is out of this world. For years, raisins were the only sweet she’s tasted. The family saved up to watch a dubbed Dangal, and cried at the end, because it was a story of a father guiding his daughters to success.

“I remember her nerve impulse had flared up when Thulasi asked why she’s not good enough for internationals. But once she knew, her mind was made up.”

Pursuing her second year of veterinary studies, she needed to travel abroad and miss college. Coach Irfan scouting for Gopichand academy linked her up with the national coach, and his mother was especially decisive, declaring Thulasimathi would get the best training in Hyderabad. Olympic Gold Quest chipped in with travel and tournament expenses.

“She sacrificed one year of college, and had to repeat the year. But after that, the Tamil Nadu government had to intervene, pass an order to exempt her from mandatory attendance because in Vet courses, you can’t just take off. She had to get admitted to obscure Namakkal. The gym there was in bad shape. We had only seen Gopi sir as a chief guest and never dreamt he would invite Thulasi to train there. But Irfan sir made it happen and she went to Hyderabad,” Kiruttigha remembers.

A massive fan of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty, whose videos she watches on YouTube, Thulasimathi was now at the same academy and thrilled to learn.

“Oh god, she would drive me crazy, keeping me awake to watch Saina or Sindhu strokes, and play them the next morning. If she could play a Prannoy Anna or Srikanth-like shot, that’s it, Thulasi would be happy the whole week. Now imagine she could speak to them. Gopi sir always checked if she was happy and told her she would win if she enjoyed,” Kiruttigha says.

Coach Irfan says the youngster was destined for greatness. “Because of her education and intelligence, she grasps the game very easily. The father had trained her well. We just gave her focus. She’s versatile, can attack, can defend, the IQ is very high,” he says of her net-rushes and jump-smashes.

The non-playing damaged arm poses a major challenge in body balance, especially when moving laterally left. “When moving sideways or front and back, the non-functioning arm’s an issue. But she moves very fast on court and is agile,” Irfan explained.

CBI arrests former R G Kar Medical College principal Sandip Ghosh over ‘financial misconduct’,Ravik Bhattacharya,2024-09-02 20:58:15+05:30,"EVEN AS protests continue over the rape and murder of a junior doctor at Kolkata’s R G Kar Medical College and Hospital, the CBI on Monday arrested the institute’s former principal Sandip Ghosh and three others in a corruption case.

The central agency, which has been conducting parallel probes into the rape-murder as well as allegations of financial irregularities at the hospital that emerged later, questioned Ghosh earlier in the day at its CGO Complex office in Salt Lake. After hours of questioning, Ghosh was escorted in the evening to the CBI’s Nizam Palace office, which houses the agency’s anti-corruption wing, and placed under arrest.

The CBI had been questioning Ghosh, 53, for the past 15 days in connection with the rape-murder as well as the alleged corruption, both of which happened when he was the hospital’s administrator.

Within an hour of the arrest, the CBI arrested three others — Ghosh’s security guard Afsar Ali Khan and two hospital vendors, identified as Biplav Singha (52) and Sumon Hazra (46).

The corruption investigation against Ghosh was initiated following a petition filed by Akhtar Ali, a former deputy superintendent at RG Kar, in the Calcutta High Court after the rape-murder of the junior doctor on August 21.

Accusing Ghosh of embezzlement of government funds, trafficking of biomedical waste, nepotism and violation of procurement laws, Ali had sought a probe by the Enforcement Directorate. On August 23, the High Court ordered the transfer of the probe into the alleged financial irregularities from a state-constituted Special Investigation Team to the CBI and asked Ghosh to proceed on leave.

Ghosh was the principal of R G Kar Medical College from February 2021 to September 2023, when he was transferred to Murshidabad Medical College on an earlier complaint filed by Ali with state vigilance.

While Ali too was transferred out, Ghosh was reinstated within a month as principal of R G Kar Medical College and Hospital, a position he held until August 12 when he resigned following protests over the rape and murder. His removal was one of the primary demands of the protesting resident doctors and junior doctors.

But within hours of his resignation, Ghosh was reinstated by the state government as principal of the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital.

However, following protests, he was asked by the High Court to proceed on leave.

On August 24, the CBI filed an FIR under section 120B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (fraud) and Section 7 of Prevention of Corruption Act in which it named Ghosh, Ma Tara Traders of Madhya Jhorehat in Howrah, Eshan Cafe at Belgachia and Khana Louha.

Reacting to Ghosh’s arrest, the father of the junior doctor who was raped and murdered said, “While I’m relieved by the CBI’s arrest, there’s no true solace. I would still say there is nothing to celebrate for me. However, we welcome the arrest.”

TMC leader and former Rajya Sabha member Santanu Sen, a doctor himself, said, “When I joined as chairman of RG Kar Rogi Kalyan Samiti in February 2023, I had taken out details of all corruption charges against him and had tried to stop him. I had also informed the Health Secretary but no step was taken. Had the right steps been taken at the right time, we wouldn’t have had to see all this,” he said.

BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar said, “People of Bengal wanted his arrest… The CBI has honoured the demand of the people of Bengal and hence I express my gratitude.”"
Brazil’s Supreme Court bans X: Why the escalated row rings familiar in India,Karan Mahadik,2024-09-02 20:58:02+05:30,"The showdown between Elon Musk’s X and Brazil’s Supreme Court reached a tipping point on Saturday, August 31, with Justice Alexandre de Moreas placing a nationwide ban on the social media platform for failing to comply with the country’s laws.

In response to the ruling, Musk said, “Free speech is the bedrock of democracy and an unelected pseudo-judge in Brazil is destroying it for political purposes.” The ban on X was further upheld by the top court on Monday, September 2, even as the X mobile app and its web version became inaccessible to users in Brazil, who are now turning to alternative social media platforms such as Threads and Bluesky.

X had an estimated 40 million monthly active users in Brazil, which is home to the fifth largest digital population. The suspension is likely to impact the platform’s business amid declining advertising revenues.

How did the conflict escalate?

The ban on X comes on the back of a months-long feud between the platform’s owner Elon Musk and Justice de Moreas. In April 2024, the Supreme Court judge ordered dozens of X accounts to be suspended for allegedly spreading disinformation. Most of these accounts reportedly belonged to supporters of Jair Bolsonaro, the former president of Brazil who is known for his right-wing, nationalist views.

X initially complied with the court-issued blocking orders and took down the accounts in question. The company’s global government affairs team said that “court decisions” had forced the platform to block these accounts as daily fines of up to $20,000 (Rs 16.7 lakh approx.) would have been levied on X if it did not comply with the blocking orders.

However, an hour later, Musk said that he had restored the blocked accounts and called for Justice de Moraes to “resign or be impeached.” In response, the judge ordered an investigation into Musk for alleged obstruction of justice.

Last night, Alexandre de Moraes threatened our legal representative in Brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders. He did so in a secret order, which we share here to expose his actions. Despite our numerous appeals to the Supreme Court not being heard,… https://t.co/Pm2ovyydhE — Global Government Affairs (@GlobalAffairs) August 17, 2024

On August 17, X said that Justice de Moreas had issued a confidential order in which he allegedly threatened X’s legal representative with arrest if the platform did not comply with the April blocking orders. “As a result, to protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil, effective immediately,” X said.

Tensions flared up again on August 29, with Justice de Moreas giving Musk a 24-hour ultimatum to hire a new legal representative in Brazil or face suspension. Once the deadline lapsed, Justice de Moreas imposed a nationwide ban on X, directing Apple and Google to remove the X app from their respective app stores within five days.

Brazilians who continue using X via VPNs will be fined R$50,000 (Rs 7.4 lakh approx.), the ruling added. The Supreme Court also reportedly issued an order to freeze the finances of Starlink, the satellite communication services provider owned by Elon Musk’s SpaceX.

With this decision, Brazil becomes the latest addition to the list of countries that have banned X, including China, Russia, Iran, Turkmenistan, Myanmar, and North Korea.

How is Brazil vs X similar to India vs Twitter?

By raising questions on important issues such as free speech, censorship, fake news, and digital sovereignty, the feud between X and the Brazilian judiciary appears to have a lot in common with the legal tussle that broke out between Twitter and the Indian government roughly three years ago.

For instance, X pushing back against the blocking orders issued by the Brazilian Supreme Court seems to have triggered the sequence of events leading to its ban. The social media platform, which was known as Twitter at the time, had similarly resisted blocking the accounts of journalists, activists, and politicians at the request of the Indian government during the farmers’ protests back in 2021. These orders were issued under Section 69A of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, making them confidential in nature. Brazil’s blocking orders are also similarly kept secret, as per reports.

Alleged threats of arrest against X’s legal representative in the South American country mirrors a previous instance where Uttar Pradesh Police had summoned Manish Maheshwari, the then-managing director of Twitter India, over accusations that the platform showed a disputed map of India that did not reflect the country’s declared borders. The Delhi Police had also knocked on Twitter India’s office in the capital after posts by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) party members had been flagged as “manipulated media”.

On the verge of losing its safe harbour protections, Twitter had been engaged in a protracted legal battle with the Indian government for not appointing an India-based liaison as required by the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. Similarly, the order issued by Justice de Moreas required X to name a legal representative in Brazil, which the platform failed to do in time.

Back then, the regulatory pressures and controversy surrounding Twitter in India had led to the rise of a homegrown alternative called Koo, which was recently shut down due to failed acquisition talks and a cash crunch. It remains to be seen if Brazil will witness a similar trend."
"Accused of making students disrobe and filming them, school teacher denied anticipatory bail by Madhya Pradesh HC",Anand Mohan J,2024-09-02 20:54:18+05:30,"The Madhya Pradesh High Court has rejected the anticipatory bail application of a school teacher, who was accused of harassing students by making them disrobe and then allegedly filming objectionable videos of them on the pretext of checking their phones.

The teacher had told the court that she is a senior faculty member at the Indore school with 23 years of experience and was falsely implicated in the case.

However, Justice Prem Narayan Singh denied bail to the teacher and observed that as per the prosecution’s case “the act of the applicant is cruel in nature, and as a teacher, her act is highly objectionable”.

“As such, in view of the facts available in the case diary and rival submissions, no case for anticipatory bail is made out. Hence, the application is liable to be and is hereby rejected,” the court said.

The court also referred to the legal principles governing anticipatory bail as laid down by the Supreme Court in Jai Prakash Singh vs State of Bihar and others (2012), highlighting that anticipatory bail is an “extraordinary privilege” and should be granted only in “exceptional cases”.

Government advocate Anand Bhatt opposed the application by submitting that the “act of the applicant is gruesome”.

“On the pretext of checking the mobiles, she has harassed the minor children of the school and sexually harassed them. Investigation is going on and provisions of the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act is required to be aggravated. Hence, looking to the act of the applicant, anticipatory bail may not be granted to her,” Bhatt argued.

The court also noted that the prosecuting agency failed to invoke provisions of the POCSO Act and directed the police commissioner of Indore to examine the matter."
Ukraine Prez Zelenskyy urges West to allow long-range attacks and increase weapons supply,Unknown,2024-09-02 20:54:26+05:30,"In a significant development on the conflict in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Western allies on Monday to not only permit the use of their weapons for deep strikes into Russian territory but also to increase the supply of such arms to Ukraine.

Zelenskyy’s call for greater military support comes amid intensified Russian airstrikes targeting Ukrainian energy installations, infrastructure, and residential areas.

Following a meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Hendrikus Schoof in Zaporizhzhia, Zelenskiy said Kyiv was ""more positive"" about potentially receiving permission to launch strikes deeper into Russia. However, he emphasized that simply granting permission is not sufficient.

""For today, only to allow – is also not enough,"" Zelenskiy said. ""We didn't get everything we would like to use,"" Zelenskiy added, noting that some previously agreed-upon supplies have yet to be fulfilled. He said he discussed with Schoof strengthening Ukraine's air defences. He mentioned there were ""some ideas"" on how to increase the fleet of F-16 jets donated by allies, one of which was lost in a crash in Ukraine last week.

Prime Minister Schoof assured continued support from the Netherlands, ""We will keep providing air defence equipment, and F-16s, and funding for munitions."" Schoof also confirmed that the Netherlands will contribute approximately 200 million euros ($221.4 million) in aid to repair energy infrastructure and for humanitarian assistance.



The Dutch foreign ministry said in a statement that Netherlands will deliver refurbished gas turbines valued at 29.5 million euros and allocate 45 million euros for energy infrastructure repairs. This aid is part of a 400-million-euro support fund pledged by the Netherlands earlier this year.

On the front lines, Zelenskyy reported that Ukraine's cross-border operation into Russia’s Kursk region is progressing ""according to the plan"". He added that this operation may help alleviate pressure on the Pokrovsk front in eastern Ukraine, where Russian advances have recently accelerated."
"Joined BJP but no announcement due to opposition from some state leaders, says Eknath Khadse",Cdata,2024-09-02 20:42:11+05:30,"Former state minister Ekanth Khadse, who quit the NCP (SP) to join BJP, said that he has already joined the party in presence of national president J P Nadda but a public announcement regarding the same has not been made due to opposition from a group of leaders within Maharashtra.

Khadse also warned of returning to NCP (SP) if an announcement regarding his entry to BJP is not made in the next few days.

“I have joined the BJP in the presence of party president J P Nadda, senior leader Vinod Tawde and Union minister Rakshatai Khadse. Naddaji welcomed me to the party. However, the public announcement of it has not been made since some leaders in Maharashtra are opposing it,” said Khadse.

“I have decided to wait for some days. If the party is unwilling to announce my return publicly, I will go back to the NCP(SP) and help them in the Assembly elections,” the former minister added.

Khadse had quit BJP to join the united NCP led by Sharad Pawar two years ago owing to his differences with party leaders Devendra Fadnavis and Girish Mahajan.

Mahajan and Khadse hail from Jalgaon district in north Maharashtra and the former is a close aide of Fadnavis.

After joining the NCP, he was made a member of legislative council and was even speculated to be contesting the recently concluded Lok Sabha election from Raver constituency.

However, the Delhi leadership of the BJP reportedly mended the differences and ensured that he does not contest. Instead, Khadse extended support to his daughter-in-law Raksha Khadse, who was the sitting Raver MP belonging to BJP.

After the formation of the NDA government at the Centre, Raksha Khadse was made a minister of state. Since then, Eknath Khadse’s official return to the party is being discussed.

According to sources, the state unit of the BJP is worried about the changed political dynamics at Jalgaon district and fear that it may face backlash if the leader returns. Also, Mahajan and Khadse have always been at odds against each other due to local politics.

State BJP president Chandrashekhar Bawankule said that that he was unaware of Khadse’s statement and added that he hoped the former minister would extend support to BJP candidates in the upcoming Assembly polls.

“I don’t know about his statement, but I know that in the Lok Sabha polls, he extended all his support to our candidate Raksha Khadse and ensured her victory. We are sure that he will do the same in the Assembly elections and make BJP candidates win the polls,” said Bawankule."
"Plot to Kharge family trust: Governor seeks explanation, Priyank says ‘lightning speed’ action",Cdata,2024-09-02 20:41:24+05:30,"Karnataka Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot has sought an explanation from the Congress government over the grant of a Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) site to a trust run by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge’s family and headed by his son Rahul, in March 2024, based on petitions by the Leader of Opposition in Legislative Council Chalavadi T Narayanaswamy and other BJP leaders.

Mallikarjun Kharge’s other son and Karnataka IT/BT and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister Priyank Kharge told reporters Monday that the Governor has written to Chief Secretary Shalini Rajneesh, seeking explanation on the land allotted to Siddhartha Vihar Trust.

Priyank is a trustee in the Trust that was allotted the 5 acres at the Hitech Defence Aerospace Park near Bengaluru. Formed in July 1994, its other trustees include Rahul Kharge and Kharge’s son-in-law and Gulbarga MP Radhakrishna.

This comes after the Governor granted prosecution sanction against CM Siddaramaiah in the alleged MUDA land allocation scam. The Karnataka HC Monday extended till September 9 the interim stay on trial court proceedings against the CM in connection with the case. On August 19, the CM moved to HC challenging the legality of the Governor’s order.

Hitting out at Gehlot, Priyank Kharge said that Gehlot has acted in “lightning speed” on complaints against Congress leaders, but with “tortoise speed” on ones against BJP and JD(S) leaders. “The Governor’s office becomes active when BJP has to be strengthened…” Kharge said, adding that despite documents against BJP and JD(S) “rotting” on his table, he has not taken action.

Narayanaswamy on August 27 petitioned the Governor seeking the dismissal of Priyank Kharge from Cabinet over the alleged allotment. Alleging “nepotism”, he said it is a case of criminal breach of trust from the Kharge family towards the fellow Schedule Caste entrepreneurs.

On August 27, Karnataka Industries Minister M B Patil had confirmed the allocation to the Siddhartha Vihara Trust, adding that no rules were violated, with the site given “at prescribed price, with no discounts.” The 5-acre parcel was part of 45.94 acres set aside for setting up civic amenities at the aerospace park, to be allocated under the Scheduled Caste quota.

Earlier in a post on X, Priyank Kharge denied the allegations and said that the site allotted was not “an industrial plot meant for industrial or commercial purposes” but for “educational purposes.” “The intention of the trust is to set up a multi skill development centre in the CA site. Is it wrong?”

BJP Rajya Sabha MP Lahar Singh Siroya first raised the allegations over the allocation in a post, quoting a report from a news website.

He added that they would launch a movement if their demands were not met.

EXPLAINED: Why North Korea’s Olympic silver medalists may face punishment for smiling during a selfie with ‘number one enemy’ – South Korean counterparts,Cdata,2024-09-02 20:23:46+05:30,"North Korean Table Tennis duo of Kim Kum-Yong and Ri Jong-Sik made history at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Not just by winning a silver medal in the mixed doubles category, but by posing for a selfie at the podium alongside their South Korean and Chinese counterparts. A selfie that was posted by the Paris 2024 official handle, and one that went viral – encapsulating the very essence of the modern Olympic Games. However, a month later, it is learnt that the moment hasn’t been received well back home where the duo are facing ‘ideological scrutiny’ for their actions.

After finishing second on the podium for the Table Tennis mixed category event at Paris 2024, Kim Kum-Yong and Ri Jong-Sik were seen posing alongside South Korea’s bronze medalists Lim Jong-Hoon and Shin Yubin during the medals ceremony, with the gold medalists, China’s Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha joining them soon after.

Reaction back home

According to Daily NK, the ruling party officials in Pyongyang have received a report containing negative post-Olympics evaluation of Kim Kum-Yong and Ri Jong-Sik. The report points out to the duo ‘grinning’ while standing next to their counterparts from South Korea – the ‘number one enemy’ nation. The fact that it was widely covered by the international media seems to have made the matters worse for the athletes following their mandatory ‘ideological review’.

What is an ideological review?

A three-step assessment that is mandatory in North Korea after athletes return from an international tournament from any non-communist country to evaluate any form of ‘exposure to contamination’ in their ideology.

It is conducted by the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, the Ministry of Physical Culture and Sports, and the athletes themselves. Speaking to the Daily NK, a source explained, “The assessment begins the moment the athletes return home. They have to ‘scrub’ their ideology as soon as possible.” Use of the term ‘scrubbing’ indicative of the country’s communist regime and how simply spending time overseas is deemed enough to ‘contaminate’ people in the form of exposure to nonsocialist cultures.

During this three-step process, the athletes who have made contact with athletes from other countries are expected to acknowledge their actions as wrong, or else they might face political and legal actions in the future.

Response from Human Rights Watch

Commenting on the reports coming out of North Korea, the international non-government organization on human rights stated that the International Olympic Committee must step forward to protect the athletes in such instances.

“The International Olympic Committee… has a responsibility to protect athletes from all forms of harassment and abuse, as set out in the Olympic Charter,” Human Rights Watch said in a statement.

“North Korean athletes should not fear retribution for actions at the Games, not least when their actions embody the values of respect and friendship, on which the Olympic movement is built,” it added."

US Prez Biden criticizes Israel PM Netanyahu for not doing enough to secure hostage deal,Unknown,2024-09-02 20:15:51+05:30,"US President Joe Biden revealed on Monday that he is nearing the completion of a final proposal aimed at securing the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, according to Reuters.

Speaking at the White House, Biden expressed his dissatisfaction with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's efforts to advance the agreement, stating bluntly that he does not believe Netanyahu is doing enough.

Biden’s comments followed the recent recovery of six hostages' bodies by Israeli forces from a tunnel in Gaza. Among the deceased is Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a 23-year-old American-Israeli. The hostages were reportedly killed by Hamas militants shortly before being discovered.

The discovery of the hostages’ bodies has intensified criticism of the Biden administration's approach to the Gaza ceasefire and has increased domestic pressure on Netanyahu to secure the release of the remaining captives.

When asked if Netanyahu was adequately addressing the situation, Biden responded simply, ""No,"" without providing further details. He did indicate, however, that a final proposal for the hostage deal could be presented to both sides within the week, adding, ""We're very close to that.""

Regarding the proposal's potential success, he remained optimistic, saying, ""Hope springs eternal.""

Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were slated to meet with the US hostage deal negotiating team, on Monday, to discuss efforts toward an agreement for the release of the remaining captives.

Meanwhile, Israeli protesters took to the streets for a second consecutive day on Monday, and the country's largest trade union, Histadrut, initiated a general strike to pressure the government into securing a deal for the return of hostages still held by Hamas. The discovery of six additional captives' bodies in Gaza intensified the unrest.

Rhea Chakraborty recalls her friends dining and drinking with her parents while she and brother Showik were in jail,Cdata,2024-09-02 20:09:21+05:30,"Apart from spending 28 days in Byculla Jail following the death of her boyfriend, actor Sushant Singh Rajput, due to accusations that she procured drugs for him, Rhea Chakraborty endured severe media trials and online trolling, which left lasting emotional scars on her.

In a recent conversation with Humans of Bombay, Chakraborty discussed the relentless persecution she faced, explaining that she was ‘forced’ to choose the path of forgiveness for her own peace of mind. However, she admitted she hasn’t forgiven everyone. “If I am being completely honest, I have not forgiven everybody. Some people are on my hit list. If so happens that my life takes me to a place where I am not powerless, and I gather the power and social influence required to make things right, I will.”

Amid all the struggles, Rhea Chakraborty’s friends remained a source of support for her and her family. She recounted how some friends dined and drank with her parents to help them feel “normal” while she and her brother Showik were in jail.

“One of my friends – a couple of friends – they used to drink with my dad and eat food with him every night while we were inside. When I came out, I was like, ‘Why have you gained so much weight? Kameeno, main waha jail mein thi aur tumlog yaha khana khaa rahe ho, weight put on kar rahe ho (I was in jail and you were eating food and putting on weight).’ They were like, ‘No, dude. We were just trying to make uncle-aunty eat and drink and make them feel a little normal.’ And I was like, ‘Oh wow!’” Chakraborty shared during the same chat with HoB.

Some of my girlfriends – the way they stood by me – my God! You don’t need anything else – you can have one true friend in life and that’s enough. Shibani (Dandekar) was that for me. The way Shibani stood for me was enough for me to know that the whole world can be against me but I have one friend,” Chakraborty added.

Rahul Gandhi’s visit to mark beginning of Congress campaign in Maharashtra,Alok Deshpande,2024-09-02 19:57:22+05:30,"The upcoming visit of Rahul Gandhi, Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, to Maharashtra on September 5 marks the beginning of Congress’s campaign for the state Assembly elections scheduled to be held later this year.

Gandhi will be accompanied by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar in Sangli — a traditional Congress stronghold since independence — to inaugurate a statue and memorial of the late Patangrao Kadam, a prominent leader from Western Maharashtra.

This will be Kharge’s second visit to Maharashtra in three weeks. Last month, he attended a joint MVA programme in Mumbai, commemorating the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. With the Maharashtra Assembly polls anticipated within the next two months, the party’s national leadership is dedicating significant time and resources to the state.

Sources within the party indicate that both Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi will be touring various locations in Maharashtra leading up to the campaign’s official launch. “Our national leadership will be very much visible in Maharashtra throughout the next two months. Kharge ji, Rahul ji and Priyanka ji will be making visits to the state,” said a senior Congress leader from Maharashtra.

In addition to leveraging the national leadership, Congress’ campaign strategy includes decentralising responsibilities to state leaders. During the Lok Sabha elections, regional stalwarts were assigned specific constituencies that minimised infighting and allowed each leader to concentrate on their area of influence. This approach will be replicated for the assembly elections.

The party aims to maintain the momentum of its performance in the Lok Sabha polls, where Congress emerged as the leading party in Maharashtra with 13 seats, and with an independent MP from Sangli pledging support. The strategy involves focusing on local dynamics and empowering local leaders to make decisions to achieve favourable results.

To counter welfare schemes such as the CM Majhi Ladki Bahin announced by the Mahayuti government, the MVA parties will release a joint manifesto. There will be joint meetings of party cadres across the state and coordinated efforts through joint war rooms to ensure better collaboration among the allies.

“We are focused on winning the assembly polls and we will be contesting the election in an alliance. Therefore, we are focused on ensuring joint campaigns as well,” said the leader.

Protests on the lines of the Jode Mara (hit with a shoe) campaign held by the MVA over the collapse of the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj will be held throughout the state. There will be protests on the issue of women safety and law and order situation in the state. Unemployment, MSP for crops, crop insurance and farm loan waiver would be the core of the joint protest.

To appeal to urban voters, the party is also highlighting urban infrastructure issues, such as potholes, stalled projects and corruption. The Mumbai Youth Congress has been actively organising protests on these issues.

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Maharashtra Congress Chief Nana Patole stated, “Congress is focused on real issues such as inflation, unemployment, and the deteriorating law and order situation. There is significant anger against the current government, and we believe that as in the Lok Sabha elections, the people of Maharashtra will defeat the Mahayuti in the assembly polls as well.”"
Israeli outpost settlers rapidly seizing West Bank land,Unknown,,"Extremist settlers rapidly seizing West Bank land

BBC

Last October, Palestinian grandmother Ayesha Shtayyeh says a man pointed a gun at her head and told her to leave the place she had called home for 50 years. She told the BBC the armed threat was the culmination of an increasingly violent campaign of harassment and intimidation that began in 2021, after an illegal settler outpost was established close to her home in the occupied West Bank. The number of these outposts has risen rapidly in recent years, new BBC analysis shows. There are currently at least 196 across the West Bank, and 29 were set up last year - more than in any previous year. The outposts - which can be farms, clusters of houses, or even groups of caravans - often lack defined boundaries and are illegal under both Israeli and international law. But the BBC World Service has seen documents showing that organisations with close ties to the Israeli government have provided money and land used to establish new illegal outposts. The BBC has also analysed open source intelligence to examine their proliferation, and has investigated the settler who Ayesha Shtayyeh says threatened her. Experts say outposts are able to seize large swathes of land more rapidly than settlements, and are increasingly linked to violence and harassment towards Palestinian communities.

Matthew Cassel / BBC Ayesha Shtayyeh is attempting to return to the home she was forced to leave

Official figures for the number of outposts do not exist. But BBC Eye reviewed lists of them and their locations gathered by Israeli anti-settlement watchdogs Peace Now and Kerem Navot - as well as the Palestinian Authority, which runs part of the occupied West Bank. We analysed hundreds of satellite images to verify that outposts had been constructed at these locations and to confirm the year they were set up. The BBC also checked social media posts, Israeli government publications and news sources to corroborate this and to show that outposts were still in use. Our analysis suggests almost half (89) of the 196 outposts we verified have been built since 2019.

Some of these are linked to growing violence against Palestinian communities in the West Bank. Earlier this year, the British government sanctioned eight extremist settlers for inciting or perpetrating violence against Palestinians. At least six had established, or are living on, illegal outposts. A former commander of the Israeli army in the West Bank, Avi Mizrahi, says most settlers are law-abiding Israeli citizens, but he does admit the existence of outposts makes violence more likely. “Whenever you put outposts illegally in the area, it brings tensions with the Palestinians… living in the same area,” he says. One of the extremist settlers sanctioned by the UK was Moshe Sharvit - the man Ayesha says threatened her at gunpoint. Both he and the outpost he set up less than 800m (0.5miles) from Ayesha's home, were also sanctioned by the US government in March. His outpost was described as a “base from which he perpetrates violence against Palestinians”. “He’s made our life hell,” Ayesha says, who must now live with her son in a town close to Nablus.

Outposts lack any official Israeli planning approval - unlike settlements, which are larger, typically urban, Jewish enclaves built throughout the West Bank, legal under Israeli law. Both are considered illegal under international law, which forbids moving a civilian population into an occupied territory. But many settlers living in the West Bank claim that, as Jews, they have a religious and historical connection to the land. In July, the UN’s top court, in a landmark opinion, said Israel should stop all new settlement activity and evacuate all settlers from the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Israel rejected the opinion as “fundamentally wrong” and one-sided. Despite outposts having no legal status, there is little evidence that the Israeli government has been trying to prevent their rapid growth in numbers. The BBC has seen new evidence showing how two organisations with close ties to the Israeli state have provided money and land used to set up new outposts in the West Bank.

Matthew Cassel / BBC Outposts often lack defined boundaries and are illegal under Israeli law

One is the World Zionist Organization (WZO), an international body founded more than a century ago and instrumental in the establishment of the state of Israel. It has a Settlement Division - responsible for managing large areas of the land occupied by Israel since 1967. The division is funded entirely by Israeli public funds and describes itself as an “arm of the Israeli state”. Contracts obtained by Peace Now, and analysed by the BBC, show the Settlement Division has repeatedly allocated land on which outposts have been built. In the contracts, the WZO forbids the building of any structures and says the land should only be used for grazing or farming - but satellite imagery reveals that, in at least four cases, illegal outposts were built on it. One of these contracts was signed by Zvi Bar Yosef in 2018. He - like Moshe Sharvit - was sanctioned by the UK and US earlier this year for violence and intimidation against Palestinians. We contacted the WZO to ask if it was aware that multiple tracts of land it had allocated for grazing and farming were being used for the construction of illegal outposts. It did not respond. We also put questions to Zvi Bar Yosef, but received no reply. The BBC has also uncovered two documents revealing that another key settler organisation - Amana - loaned hundreds of thousands of shekels to help establish outposts. In one case, the organisation loaned NIS 1,000,000 ($270,000/£205,000) to a settler to build greenhouses on an outpost considered illegal under Israeli law.

Open source court papers relating to a civil dispute involving a settler reveal that Amana loaned money used for outposts

Amana was founded in 1978 and has worked closely with the Israeli government to build settlements throughout the West Bank ever since. But in recent years, there has been growing evidence that Amana also supports outposts. In a recording from a meeting of executives in 2021, leaked by an activist, Amana’s CEO Ze’ev Hever can be heard stating that: “In the last three years… one operation we have expanded is the herding farm [outposts].” “Today, the area [they control] is almost twice the size of built settlements.” This year, the Canadian government included Amana in a round of sanctions against individuals and organisations responsible for “violent and destabilising actions against Palestinian civilians and their property in the West Bank”. The sanctions did not mention outposts. There is also a trend of the Israeli government retroactively legalising outposts - effectively transforming them into settlements. Last year, for example, the government began the process of legalising at least 10 outposts, and granted at least six others full legal status.

Matthew Cassel / BBC Nabil says Sharvit would chase him off land he has used for years

In February, Moshe Sharvit - the settler Ayesha Shtayyeh says evicted her from her home - hosted an open day at his outpost, filmed by a local camera crew. Speaking candidly, he laid out just how effective outposts can be for capturing land. “The biggest regret when we [settlers] built settlements was that we got stuck within the fences and couldn’t expand,” he told the crowd. “The farm is very important, but the most important thing for us is the surrounding area.” He claimed he now controls about 7,000 dunams (7 sq km) of land - an area greater than many large, urban settlements in the West Bank with populations in the thousands. Gaining control over large areas, often at the expense of Palestinian communities, is a key goal for some settlers who set up and live on outposts, says Hagit Ofran of Peace Now. “Settlers who live on the hilltop [outposts] see themselves as ‘protecting lands’ and their daily job is to kick out Palestinians from the area,” she says. Ayesha says that Moshe Sharvit began a campaign of harassment and intimidation almost as soon as he set up his outpost in late 2021. When her husband, Nabil, grazed his goats in pastures he had used for decades, Sharvit would quickly arrive in an all-terrain vehicle and he and young settlers would chase the animals away, he says. “I responded that we’d leave if the government, or police, or judge tells us to,” Nabil says. “He told me: ‘I’m the government, and I’m the judge, and I’m the police.’”

Through limiting access to grazing land, outpost settlers like Moshe Sharvit are able to put Palestinian farmers in increasingly precarious positions, says Moayad Shaaban, the head of the Palestinian Authority’s Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission. “It reaches a point where Palestinians don’t have anything anymore. They can’t eat, they can’t graze, can’t get water,” he says. Following the 7 October Hamas attacks on southern Israel and Israel’s war in Gaza, Moshe Sharvit’s harassment became even more aggressive, says Ariel Moran, who supports Palestinian communities facing settler aggression. Sharvit had always carried a pistol with him in the fields, but now he began approaching activists and Palestinians with an assault rifle slung over his shoulder and his threats became more menacing, Ariel says. “I think he saw the chance of taking a shortcut and not waiting for another year or two years of gradually wearing them [Palestinian families] out. “Just do it overnight. And it worked.” Many of the families, like Ayesha’s, who say they left their homes following threats from Moshe Sharvit, did so in the weeks immediately following 7 October. Throughout the West Bank, OCHA - the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs - says settler violence has reached “unprecedented levels”. In the past 10 months, it has recorded more than 1,100 settler attacks against Palestinians. At least 10 Palestinians have been killed and more than 230 injured by settlers since 7 October, it says. At least five settlers have been killed and at least 17 injured by Palestinians in the West Bank over the same time frame, OCHA says.

In December 2023, two months after they say they were forced from their home, we filmed Ayesha and Nabil as they returned to collect some of their belongings. When they arrived at the house, they found it had been ransacked. In the kitchen, the cupboards hung from their hinges. In the living room, someone had taken a knife to the sofas, slashing through the upholstery. “I didn’t hurt him. I didn’t do anything to him. What have I done to deserve this?” Ayesha said. As they began to sort through the damage, Moshe Sharvit arrived in a buggy. Before long, the Israeli police and army arrived. They told the couple, and the Israeli peace activists accompanying them, that they had to leave the area. “He hasn’t left anything for us,” Ayesha told the BBC.

Netanyahu asks Israelis for 'forgiveness' over hostage deaths,Unknown,,"Netanyahu asks 'forgiveness' over hostage deaths as protests continue

Reuters

Benjamin Netanyahu has asked for ""forgiveness"" from Israelis for failing to return six hostages found dead in Gaza on Saturday, as Hamas warned more could be ""returned to their families in shrouds"" if a ceasefire isn't reached. His comments came as intense street protests over his handling of negotiations entered a second night in Israel. Pressure also mounted internationally as the UK suspended some arms sales to Israel, citing a risk of equipment being used to violate international law. But Israel's prime minister struck a defiant tone, insisting its troops must control Gaza's Philadelphi Corridor - a strategically important strip of land which is a sticking point in negotiations with Hamas.

Thousands of Israelis took to the streets on Monday in fresh protests called by hostages' families to express their anger at Mr Netanyahu's failure to bring home their loved ones after almost 11 months. The Times of Israel reported that police were using considerable aggression at one protest outside the prime minister’s home in Jerusalem, including violently pushing protesters, throwing some to the ground, and dragging many away. One member of the police squeezed the throat of a Times of Israel reporter, according to the newspaper. The latest demonstrations come after hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in protests across the country on Sunday, with some demonstrators blocking a major highway in Tel Aviv. Many wore Israeli flags and hung yellow ribbons - a symbol of solidarity with the hostages - from a bridge overlooking the Ayalon Highway. A total of 97 hostages remain unaccounted for after being kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October last year. Hamas said on Monday that hostages would be returned ""inside coffins"" if military pressure from Israel continues and added that ""new instructions"" have been given to militants guarding captives if they are approached by Israeli troops. ""Netanyahu's insistence to free prisoners through military pressure, instead of sealing a deal means they will be returned to their families in shrouds. Their families must choose whether they want them dead or alive,"" a spokesperson for the group said, without elaborating on what new orders had been issued. Earlier on Monday, Israel's biggest trade union said hundreds of thousands of people had joined a general strike called to put pressure on the government to agree a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas. Despite this, Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport reported limited disruption and many restaurants and hospitality services operated as normal. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich boasted that Israelis had gone to work “in droves” and proved that they were no longer slaves to “political needs”.

'No' - Biden asked if Netanyahu is doing enough on hostage issue

Elsewhere, US President Joe Biden said Mr Netanyahu was not doing enough to secure a hostage deal and ceasefire with Hamas, amid reports suggesting a new proposal would be sent to the Israeli prime minister as ""final"". Many accuse Mr Netanyahu of blocking a deal to prioritise his own political survival - a claim he rejects. Mr Netanyahu's far-right allies have threatened to pull out of the coalition government, undermining his chances of staying in power, if he were to accept a deal tied to a permanent ceasefire before Hamas was destroyed. US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to broker a ceasefire deal that would see Hamas release the 97 hostages still being held, including 33 who are presumed dead, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.

EPA The UK's foreign secretary said Israel's actions in Gaza continue to lead to ""widespread destruction""

UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Monday that the UK had suspended 30 out of 350 arms export licences to Israel, citing a ""clear risk"" the equipment could be used to commit serious violations of international law. The affected equipment includes parts for fighter jets, helicopters and drones. Mr Lammy said the UK continued to support Israel's right to defend itself, and this did not amount to an arms embargo. Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant posted on X, to say he was ""deeply disheartened"" by the move, while Foreign Minister Israel Katz said it sent a ""very problematic message"" to Hamas and Iran. Meanwhile, funeral services for some of the hostages killed on Saturday have been held. The mother of Hersh Goldberg-Polin - one of the hostages whose body was recovered by Israel on Saturday - spoke at his funeral and said she had been in ""such torment and worry"" about him for months. Rachel Goldberg-Polin said it had been a ""stunning honour"" to be her son’s mother. Around the time of his kidnap, Hersh sent two texts to his family, writing: ""I love you guys,” and ""I’m sorry"". Mourners lined the streets in Jerusalem and Israel's President Isaac Herzog spoke to relatives at the funeral."

EPA Protesters carried mock coffins outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence, symbolising the six dead Israeli hostages retrieved from Gaza

On Monday evening, protestors carried empty coffins past Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house – the burden he carries is much heavier, they say. Since six Israeli hostages were found dead in a Gaza tunnel last weekend, the weight of the war there has hung heavier on Israel’s leader. “I think the fact that they were alive and murdered right before they could have been saved – that broke it,” said Anna Rubin, who joined a protest in Tel Aviv. “That’s a breaking point for a lot of people – [they] are on the edge of their seat, and they realise that sitting at home is not going to do anything.”

Anna Rubin was at the protest in Tel Aviv

Tens of thousands of people took to the streets again on Monday, after mass demonstrations flooded Tel Aviv last night. Many want to see this moment as a turning point, but Prime Minister Netanyahu has been here before. He’s lived through months of these street protests – and years of similar ones. Protected by a parliamentary majority, his strategy has largely been to ignore their demands. But then, if Mr Netanyahu isn’t listening, many people in Israel are not protesting. A one-day general strike, called by the country’s labour union, was very patchily observed – even in Tel Aviv, the country’s beach-side liberal heartland. Shops and restaurants in the city centre were mostly open, after briefly closing in solidarity with the protest on Sunday night. “I don’t agree with the decision,” one of the staff at local cafe told me. “We should have closed.” Tamara was picking up a street scooter, in large shades and perfect lipstick. “I don’t agree with the strike,” she said. “We want the hostages back – but we can’t stop everything; we need to live.” Twenty-three-year-old Niva said she was surprised to see so many places open. “The country is in a very confrontational mood now,” she said. But the most striking confrontation isn’t happening in the streets. In a live press conference on Monday night, Mr Netanyahu defied anyone to demand more concessions from Israel in its negotiations over a hostage and ceasefire deal, brokered by the US. ""These murderers executed six of our hostages; they shot them in the back of the head,” he said. “And now, after this, we’re asked to show seriousness? We’re asked to make concessions?” The message that would send to Hamas, he said, would be: “kill more hostages [and] you’ll get more concessions.”

South Korea: The deepfake crisis engulfing hundreds of schools,Unknown,,"Inside the deepfake porn crisis engulfing Korean schools

BBC

Last Saturday, a Telegram message popped up on Heejin’s phone from an anonymous sender. “Your pictures and personal information have been leaked. Let’s discuss.” As the university student entered the chatroom to read the message, she received a photo of herself taken a few years ago while she was still at school. It was followed by a second image using the same photo, only this one was sexually explicit, and fake. Terrified, Heejin, which is not her real name, did not respond, but the images kept coming. In all of them, her face had been attached to a body engaged in a sex act, using sophisticated deepfake technology. Deepfakes, the majority of which combine a real person’s face with a fake, sexually explicit body, are increasingly being generated using artificial intelligence. “I was petrified, I felt so alone,” Heejin told the BBC. But she was not alone. Two days earlier, South Korean journalist Ko Narin had published what would turn into the biggest scoop of her career. It had recently emerged that police were investigating deepfake porn rings at two of the county’s major universities, and Ms Ko was convinced there must be more. She started searching social media and uncovered dozens of chat groups on the messaging app Telegram where users were sharing photos of women they knew and using AI software to convert them into fake pornographic images within seconds. “Every minute people were uploading photos of girls they knew and asking them to be turned into deepfakes,” Ms Ko told us. Ms Ko discovered these groups were not just targeting university students. There were rooms dedicated to specific high schools and even middle schools. If a lot of content was created using images of a particular student, she might even be given her own room. Broadly labelled “humiliation rooms” or “friend of friend rooms”, they often come with strict entry terms. Ms Ko’s report in the Hankyoreh newspaper has shocked South Korea. On Monday, police announced they were considering opening an investigation into Telegram, following the lead of authorities in France, who recently charged Telegram’s Russian founder for crimes relating to the app. The government has vowed to bring in stricter punishments for those involved, and the president has called for young men to be better educated. Telegram said it ""actively combats harmful content on its platform, including illegal pornography,"" in a statement provided to the BBC.

'A systematic and organised process'

The BBC has viewed the descriptions of a number of these chatrooms. One calls for members to post more than four photos of someone along with their name, age and the area they live in. “I was shocked at how systematic and organised the process was,” said Ms Ko. “The most horrific thing I discovered was a group for underage pupils at one school that had more than 2,000 members.” In the days after Ms Ko’s article was published, women’s rights activists started to scour Telegram too, and follow leads. By the end of that week, more than 500 schools and universities had been identified as targets. The actual number impacted is still to be established, but many are believed to be aged under 16, which is South Korea's age of consent. A large proportion of the suspected perpetrators are teenagers themselves. Heejin said learning about the scale of the crisis had made her anxiety worse, as she now worried how many people might have viewed her deepfakes. Initially she blamed herself. “I couldn’t stop thinking did this happen because I uploaded my photos to social media, should I have been more careful?” Scores of women and teenagers across the country have since removed their photos from social media or deactivated their accounts altogether, frightened they could be exploited next. “We are frustrated and angry that we are having to censor our behaviour and our use of social media when we have done nothing wrong,” said one university student, Ah-eun, whose peers have been targeted. Ah-eun said one victim at her university was told by police not to bother pursuing her case as it would be too difficult to catch the perpetrator, and it was “not really a crime” as “the photos were fake”.

News 1 South Koreans have been shocked and angry since the deepfake scandal has come to light

At the heart of this scandal is the messaging app Telegram. Unlike public websites, which the authorities can access easily, and then request for images be removed, Telegram is a private, encrypted messaging app. Users are often anonymous, rooms can be set to “secret” mode, and their contents quickly deleted without a trace. This has made it a prime space for criminal behaviour to flourish. Last week, politicians and the police responded forcefully, promising to investigate these crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice. On Monday, Seoul National Police Agency announced it would look to investigate Telegram over its role in enabling fake pornographic images of children to be distributed. South Korea faces deepfake porn 'emergency'

South Korean women protest in Seoul over hidden sex cameras The app’s founder, Pavel Durov, was charged in France last week with being complicit in a number of crimes related to the app, including enabling the sharing of child pornography. But women's rights activists accuse the authorities in South Korea of allowing sexual abuse on Telegram to simmer unchecked for too long, because Korea has faced this crisis before. In 2019, it emerged that a sex ring was using Telegram to coerce women and children into creating and sharing sexually explicit images of themselves. Police at the time asked Telegram for help with their investigation, but the app ignored all seven of their requests. Although the ringleader was eventually sentenced to more than 40 years in jail, no action was taken against the platform, because of fears around censorship. “They sentenced the main actors but otherwise neglected the situation, and I think this has exacerbated the situation,” said Ms Ko.

Chat groups like these are offering to create deepfake images. The bottom one notes that “if you request someone to be humiliated (deepfaked), we will do so”

Park Jihyun, who, as a young student journalist, uncovered the Nth room sex-ring back in 2019, has since become a political advocate for victims of digital sex crimes. She said that since the deepfake scandal broke, pupils and parents had been calling her several times a day crying. “They have seen their school on the list shared on social media and are terrified.” Ms Park has been leading calls for the government to regulate or even ban the app in South Korea. “If these tech companies will not cooperate with law enforcement agencies, then the state must regulate them to protect its citizens,” she said. Before this latest crisis exploded, South Korea’s Advocacy Centre for Online Sexual Abuse victims (ACOSAV) was already noticing a sharp uptick in the number of underage victims of deepfake pornography. In 2023 they counselled 86 teenage victims. That jumped to 238 in just the first eight months of this year. In the past week alone, another 64 teen victims have come forward. One of the centre’s leaders, Park Seonghye, said over the past week her staff had been inundated with calls and were working around the clock. “It’s been a full scale emergency for us, like a wartime situation,” she said. “With the latest deepfake technology there is now so much more footage than there used to be, and we’re worried it’s only going to increase.” As well as counselling victims, the centre tracks down harmful content and works with online platforms to have it taken down. Ms Park said there had been some instances where Telegram had removed content at their request. “So it’s not impossible,” she noted. In a statement, Telegram told the BBC that its moderators “proactively monitor public parts of the app, use AI tools and accept user reports in order to remove millions of pieces of content each day that breach Telegram's terms of service”. While women’s rights organisations accept that new AI technology is making it easier to exploit victims, they argue this is just the latest form of misogyny to play out online in South Korea. First women were subjected to waves of verbal abuse online. Then came the spy cam epidemic, where they were secretly filmed using public toilets and changing rooms. ""The root cause of this is structural sexism and the solution is gender equality,” read a statement signed by 84 women’s groups. This is a direct criticism of the country’s President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has denied the existence of structural sexism, cut funding to victim support groups and is abolishing the government’s gender equality ministry.

Edmundo González: Arrest warrant issued for Venezuela opposition candidate,Unknown,,"Arrest warrant issued for Venezuela opposition candidate

The opposition says it has evidence showing Edmundo González (centre) won the election

But the government has yet to publish any evidence to support its claim of victory, while the opposition says their polling data shows Mr González won easily.

Mr Maduro was declared the winner of July's election by the country's electoral council - which is stacked with government loyalists.

It comes after a request by the public prosecutor's office, which is loyal to President Nicolás Maduro.

A judge in Venezuela has issued an arrest warrant for Edmundo González, the opposition's candidate in the country's recent presidential election.

Supporters of the Venezuelan opposition leader have protested against the results of the presidential election

No sooner was the petition received from Venezuela’s public prosecutor’s office than Judge Edward Briceño, who rules on terrorism-related crimes in Venezuela, granted the request and the arrest warrant against Mr González was issued.

""No-one in this country is above the laws, above the institutions,"" President Maduro said in quotes cited by AFP news agency in his weekly television programme on Monday.

The step represents a significant ramping up of the political tensions in the South American nation.

Mr González was the candidate who ran against Mr Maduro in the country’s recent presidential election. Since the vote, his opposition alliance has published voting data online which it says shows he won the election by a huge margin, of more than 30%.

It is this data that has led to the issuance of the arrest warrant.

He is accused of ""serious crimes"" including the ""usurpation"" of public duties, document falsification, instigation of disobedience and system sabotage, according to the public prosecutor.

Mr González, who has been in hiding since shortly after the election, has denied any wrongdoing.

The European Union has said it will not recognise Mr Maduro as having won re-election in July without seeing detailed voting tallies.

Several Latin American countries have also withheld their support, with Mr Maduro's former ally, President Lula of Brazil, among those calling for full transparency by the Venezuelan government.

The US has recognised Mr González as having won most votes, saying there is ""overwhelming"" evidence of Maduro’s defeat.

However, the government-controlled National Electoral Council declared President Maduro the winner, prompting major protests across Venezuela.

The government of President Maduro has detained more than 2,400 people since the election, creating what the UN has called ""a climate of fear"".

Now, the possibility that Mr González may also be detained on charges of inciting public disorder and conspiracy has suddenly become far more likely.

Earlier, the US Department of Justice seized a plane used by President Maduro, saying it was obtained in violation of US sanctions on Venezuela.

In response, President Maduro's government accused Washington of “piracy” and of “illegally imposing its will” around the world."

Cathay Pacific grounds planes after engine problem,Unknown,,"Cathay Pacific grounds planes after engine problem

A Cathay Pacific flight to Zurich was forced to return to Hong Kong due to an ""engine component failure""

Since Monday, Cathay Pacific has cancelled two dozen return flights, including routes linking Hong Kong to Sydney, Singapore, Bangkok, Tokyo, Osaka and Taipei.

Rolls-Royce has told the BBC the plane was powered by its Trent XWB-97 engines.

The company says it is now inspecting all 48 of its Airbus A350 aircraft ""as a precautionary measure"" and has found the same faulty part in some other engines needs to be replaced.

Hong Kong’s flagship airline Cathay Pacific has cancelled tens of flights after a plane heading from the city to Zurich was forced to turn around due to an ""engine component failure"".

The airline said it expected the disruptions to continue until at least Wednesday.

Cathay Pacific said the engine component that caused its plane to return to Hong Kong was ""the first of its type to suffer such failure on any A350 aircraft worldwide.""

""Thus far we have identified a number of the same engine components that need to be replaced, spare parts have been secured and repair work is underway,"" the airline said in a statement.

""As a result, a number of aircraft will be out of service for several days while this process is being completed and Cathay Pacific’s operating schedules will be affected.""

The airline expects the inspection of its A350 fleet to be completed later on Tuesday.

Airbus did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.

Cathay Pacific took delivery of its first Airbus A350 aircraft in 2016. The planes are equipped with fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce engines.

“We are committed to working closely with the airline, aircraft manufacturer and the relevant authorities to support their investigation into this incident,” Rolls-Royce told BBC News.

Other airlines that operate A350s include British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Qatar Airways. The BBC has contacted the companies for comment.

Earlier this year, Rolls-Royce announced plans to invest in making improvements to its range of engines, including the Trent XWB-97.

In 2023, Tim Clark, the boss of gulf carrier Emirates, voiced concerns about the durability of the engine and the prices Rolls-Royce charged for maintenance."

Scores of homes perched on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean in LA County have had their electricity shut off amid steadily worsening landslides. The community of Rancho Palos Verdes - 25 miles (40km) south of downtown Los Angeles - has long grappled with unstable land, but authorities say the problem has worsened in recent months. Now, utility companies are stepping in, fearing fires and other destruction caused by rapidly shifting land while some residents insist on staying in their multi-million dollar homes. The decision by power utility company Southern California Edison on Sunday cut electricity to 140 homes in the neighbourhood of Portuguese Bend, with further cuts possible.

“The movement has accelerated dramatically over the last 12 months, where some areas are moving up to 10 inches (25cm) a week,” said city council member David Bradley, according to CNN. “You can almost see the ground move.” An additional 105 customers in the city of 42,000 people were notified that they would lose power on Monday. Last week, a downed powerline sparked a small wildfire in Portuguese Bend. ""The land movement in the Portuguese Bend community has created such a dangerous situation that we have made the very difficult decision to disconnect power indefinitely to prevent that equipment from igniting wildfire,"" Larry Chung, a spokesman for the power company. Gas and water has already been disconnected in the upscale neighbourhood. The 680-acre (276-hectare) landslide has been ongoing for years at a slow pace. But it has accelerated in part due to heavy rainfall in California over the past two years, expert say. “The acceleration that’s happening currently is beyond what any of us could have foretold, and it demands more response from the state, more response from the federal government,” said Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn at a news conference on Sunday. The top county official added that $5m (£3.8m) had been set aside for disaster relief, but more was needed. She called on California Governor Gavin Newsom to personally visit the area and declare a state of emergency.

Tim Walz unharmed after motorcade vehicles involved in crash,Unknown,,"Tim Walz unharmed after vehicles in motorcade crash

Reporters said they were ""violently thrown forward"" after being hit from behind, sending their vehicle into the car in front of them. At least one person was injured.

The crash happened around 13:00 local time (18:00 GMT) on Monday. The cars involved were at the rear of the motorcade and were carrying members of the press who travel with Mr Walz.

Multiple cars travelling in the motorcade carrying Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the Democratic candidate for vice-president, crashed in Milwaukee.

It is unclear what caused the crash, which occurred on Interstate 794.

Vice-President Kamala Harris, his running mate, phoned Mr Walz to check that he was OK, a White House official told CBS, the BBC's US partner. Mr Walz said he also received a call from President Joe Biden.

One person appeared to have broken an arm and was being treated by medics, according to a pool reporter travelling with Mr Walz.

The affected vehicles pulled over to the side of the road as Mr Walz continued ahead to a scheduled appearance.

Mr Walz addressed the incident in his remarks at a Milwaukee Labor Day event shortly after the crash.

""Some of my staff and members of the press that were travelling up with us were involved in a traffic accident on the way here today. We’ve spoken with the staff,"" he told the crowd. ""I’m relieved to say that with a few minor injuries, everybody’s going to be okay.”

Mr Walz thanked the Secret Service and local first responders ""for their quick reaction to help"".

Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance also responded to the reports, writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, ""Hoping everyone's OK.""

It's not the first time the campaign has faced a motorcade-related crash.

Last week, a Georgia policeman crashed his motorcycle while travelling with the campaign convoy.

The officer, Savannah Police Corporal David Bates, was the only person involved in the crash and sustained ""serious injuries"".

NPR reported that motorcade vehicles are often driven by campaign staff who may or may not have professional driving experience."
UK suspends some arms exports to Israel,Unknown,,"UK suspends some arms exports to Israel

EPA The foreign secretary said Israel's actions in Gaza continued to lead to ""widespread destruction""

The UK has suspended some arms sales to Israel, saying there is a ""clear risk"" the equipment could be used to commit serious violations of international law. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK would be suspending 30 out of 350 arms export licences to Israel, affecting equipment such as parts for fighter jets, helicopters and drones. An Israeli minister told the BBC that the decision sent the ""wrong message"" and was ""disappointing"", but human rights group Amnesty International UK called the suspension ""too limited"". Mr Lammy said the UK continued to support Israel's right to defend itself, and this did not amount to an arms embargo.

Speaking to Radio 4, Israel's minister for diaspora affairs, Amichai Chikli, said the decision had come ""at a very sensitive moment"" when Israelis were burying six people ""murdered in Hamas tunnels"". ""I think we need to combat terrorism together,"" he told the World Tonight programme. ""The fight against Isis [the Islamic State group], and al-Qaeda and Hamas, it's the same war between the Western civilisation and radical Islam. ""The threat that is coming from Hamas is also an inner threat that you are facing in the streets of the UK."" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in response to the decision that Israel operated according to international law. Writing on social media, the chief rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, said the move “beggars belief” and “feeds the falsehood that Israel is in breach of International Humanitarian Law”. “Sadly, this announcement will serve to encourage our shared enemies,” he added. Chief executive of Amnesty International UK, Sacha Deshmukh, criticised the restrictions as ""too limited and riddled with loopholes"". The non-profit organisation has continuously called for a ceasefire and to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. “Today’s decision means that while ministers apparently accept that Israel may be committing war crimes in Gaza, [the government] is nevertheless continuing to risk complicity in war crimes, apartheid - and possible genocide - by Israeli forces in Gaza,"" he said. Western governments have been coming under growing pressure to halt arms sales to Israel over how it is waging the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The foreign secretary said many MPs, lawyers and international organisations had raised concerns about British arms export licensing to Israel. He immediately sought a review of British arms exports to Israel after the Labour government took office in July, Mr Lammy added. He said the review did not and “could not arbitrate on whether or not Israel has breached international humanitarian law” - and this was ""not a determination of innocence or guilt"".

But he said the government had its own legal duty to review all exports licences. Mr Lammy said: ""The assessment I have received leaves me unable to conclude anything other than that for certain UK arms exports to Israel, there does exist a clear risk they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation on international humanitarian law.” He said the partial ban covered items ""which could be used in the current conflict in Gaza"". In a written summary of its decision, the government cited Israel's approach to Gaza aid and treatment of detainees as key factors in its decision. It did not explain how the suspended licences would affect these concerns. But parts made in the UK for the F35 fighters that Israel is using to strike targets in Gaza will not be included in the UK's ban because the planes are manufactured as part of a global programme. The decision is more significant politically than militarily - UK arms sales to Israel are small, just 1% of the country’s defence imports. The US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, accounting for 69% of its imports of major conventional arms between 2019 and 2023, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. But it is still striking that one of Israel’s closest allies has judged there is a clear risk the country may use some of its arms exports to violate international humanitarian law. The announcement may come as no surprise to the government of Israel – it has long been flagged - but it will still hurt.

Protests in Seville as West Nile virus kills five,Unknown,,"Protests in Seville as West Nile virus kills five

One Seville resident taking part in the protest held up a sign reading: ""No more deaths, no more fear""

Residents of Seville have held a protest demanding action to tackle the West Nile virus, which has caused five deaths in the southern Spanish province this summer.

The virus spreads to humans when mosquitoes bite infected birds and then subsequently bite humans.

All the deaths and 61 cases registered near the city of Seville occurred in the Lower Guadalquivir Valley area.

This is the worst year on record with the exception of 2020, which saw 76 registered cases and eight deaths.

The protest took place on Monday evening in the town of Isla Mayor in Seville province.

It was organised by the platform Fight against the Nile Virus, which demands more action by local and national authorities to control the spread of the disease.

The regional government of Andalusia has called for calm and said it will increase cooperation between provinces and town halls to battle the virus.

The family of Granada Romero Ruiz, an 86-year-old woman who died of the virus this summer, wrote a letter to the local authorities shortly before her death, expressing “anger and desperation”.

“This tragedy could have been avoided if you, in your comfortable offices, had acted with the responsibility and humanity that we expect from your position,” they said.

The family blamed the spread of the virus on a failure to fumigate rice fields near them."
AfD victory in Thuringia: Scholz urges 'firewall' to keep out far right,Unknown,,"Scholz urges firewall against far right after election win

Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose SPD party fared badly in both state elections, called for a firewall ""without right-wing extremists""

The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has urged mainstream parties not to lend support to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which won a big victory in the eastern state of Thuringia in Sunday's regional election.

The result gives the far right its first win in a state parliament election since World War Two.

The AfD also came a close second in Sunday's other big state election, in the more populous neighbouring state of Saxony.

The AfD has been designated as right-wing extremist in both Thuringia and Saxony. Björn Höcke, the AfD leader in Thuringia, has previously been fined for using a Nazi slogan, although he denies knowingly doing so.

On Monday, Mr Scholz urged other parties to block the AfD from governing by maintaining a so-called firewall against it.

""All democratic parties are now called upon to form stable governments without right-wing extremists,"" he said, calling the results ""bitter"" and ""worrying"".

AfD co-leader Alice Weidel said that voters in Thuringia and Saxony had given her party a ""very clear mandate to govern"".

She urged parties to ignore Mr Scholz's call to build government coalitions without the AfD, and said that doing so would ""undermine the democratic participation of large sections of the population"".

""Firewalls are undemocratic,"" Ms Weidel added.

Without the support of other parties, the AfD cannot govern in Thuringia. The second-largest party, the conservative CDU, has made clear it will not consider ruling with the far right.

Mathematically, then, the conservatives will need support from parties on the left to form a majority.

They have previously refused to work with the left-wing Die Linke, meaning they could have to look at the more radical left populist Sahra Wagenknecht's BSW to form a ruling coalition - an unpalatable option for many within the CDU.

Mr Höcke, the AfD's top candidate in Thuringia has suggested there were plenty of CDU voters who would be happy if they worked together instead.

In any case, with over 30% of the vote the AfD has a so-called ""blocking minority"" - meaning it will be able to stop the appointment of new judges or any constitutional change."
Man accused of recruiting strangers to rape his wife,Unknown,,"Man accused of recruiting dozens of strangers to rape his wife

The case has horrified France for the mass scale of the grave crimes.

The woman was so heavily sedated she was not aware of the repeat abuse, her lawyers say.

The defendant, named as 71-year-old Dominique P, is accused of recruiting strangers online to come to his home and sexually assault the victim for over a decade.

A man has gone on trial in France for repeatedly drugging and raping his wife as well as arranging for dozens of other men to rape her.

Police identified at least 92 rapes committed by 72 men. Fifty were identified and charged and are standing trial alongside the husband.

The victim, now 72, only learnt of the abuse in 2020 after being informed by police.

The trial will be ""a horrible ordeal"" for her, said her lawyer Antoine Camus, as it will be the first time she sees video evidence of the abuse.

""For the first time, she will have to live through the rapes that she endured over 10 years,"" he told AFP news agency.

Dominique P was investigated by police after an incident in September 2020, when a security guard caught him secretly filming under the skirts of three women in a shopping centre.

Police then found hundreds of pictures and videos of his wife on his computer in which she appeared to be unconscious.

The images are alleged to show dozens of assaults in the couple's home. The abuse is alleged to have started in 2011.

Investigators also found chats on a website in which Dominique P allegedly recruited strangers to come to their home and rape his wife.

He admitted to investigators that he gave his wife powerful tranquilisers, including an anxiety-reducing drug.

He is accused of taking part in the rapes, filming them and encouraging the other men using degrading language, according to prosecutors.

No money is alleged to have changed hands.

The accused rapists - aged between 26 and 74 - came from all walks of life and while most participated once, some took part up to six times, according to prosecutors.

Their defence is that they were helping a couple live out their fantasies but Dominique P told investigators that everyone was aware his wife had been drugged without her knowledge.

An expert said her state ""was closer to a coma than to sleep"".

Dominique P, who said he was raped when he was nine, is ready to face ""his family and his wife"", his lawyer Beatrice Zavarro told news agency AFP.

He has also been charged with a 1991 murder and rape, which he denies, and an attempted rape in 1999, which he admitted after DNA testing.

The trial, which is being held in Parc des Expositions in Avignon, southern France, is due to last until 20 December.

On Monday, the opening day of the trial, the woman turned up to court supported by her three children, AFP reported.

Mr Camus, her lawyer, said she could have opted for a trial behind closed doors, but ""that's what her attackers would have wanted""."

Venezuela: US police inspect President Maduro's plane

The US has seized a plane belonging to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, claiming it was bought illegally for $13m (£9.8m) and smuggled out of the country. According to the US justice department, the Falcon 900EX aircraft was seized in the Dominican Republic and transferred to the US state of Florida. It is unclear how and when the plane ended up in the Dominican Republic. Tracking data showed it leaving La Isabela airport near the capital Santo Domingo on Monday, arriving at Fort Lauderdale airport in Florida soon after. Venezuela has denounced the seizure, saying that it amounted to an act of ""piracy"".

Foreign Minister Yván Gil said the US had justified itself ""with the coercive measures that they unilaterally and illegally impose around the world"". In a statement, the Venezuelan government said it ""reserves the right to take any legal action to repair this damage to the nation"". US officials said the plane was seized for suspected violations of US export control and sanctions laws. They added that an investigation found that people affiliated with Mr Maduro had allegedly used a Caribbean-based shell company to hide their involvement in the plane's illegal purchase from a company based in Florida in late 2022 and early 2023. The aircraft was then illegally exported from the United States to Venezuela through the Caribbean in April 2023. The argument by US officials that the plane's sale and export was in violation of US sanctions is unlikely to carry much weight with President Maduro, who has repeatedly accused the US of meddling in his country’s internal affairs.

Reuters The US justice department says the plane is owned and used by Nicolás Maduro and those affiliated with him in Venezuela

A spokesperson for the White House national security council said the action represented ""an important step to ensure that Maduro continues to feel the consequences from his misgovernance of Venezuela"". Markenzy Lapointe, US attorney for the Southern District of Florida, said the Dominican Republic authorities had given the US government ""invaluable assistance"" in organising the seizure. “It doesn’t matter how fancy the private jet or how powerful the officials – we will work relentlessly with our partners here and across the globe to identify and return any aircraft illegally smuggled outside of the United States,"" said Matthew S Axelrod from the department of commerce - one of the federal agencies involved in the operation to recover the plane."
Nigeria protests: Ten activists charged with treason,Unknown,,"Ten Nigerian protesters charged with treason

The accused, who have been in detention for almost a month, all pleaded not guilty

They turned violent in some places as protesters clashed with security forces leaving at least seven dead, according to police, though rights groups have put the death toll at 23.

The demonstrations, dubbed ""10 days of rage"", were called in response to the extremely tough economic times many are living through.

All of the accused pleaded not guilty.

Ten people who took part in last month’s protests across Nigeria have been charged with treason and other serious offences at the federal high court in the capital, Abuja.

There were also nearly 700 arrests.

As well as treason, the 10 who appeared in court on Monday were charged with the destruction of public property and injuring police officers.

They were accused of working with a British citizen “to destabilise Nigeria by calling on the military to take over government from President Bola Ahmed Tinubu"", according to the charge sheet.

They allegedly shouted: ""Tinubu must go, it is soldiers we want.""

Despite an appeal that the 10 accused should be bailed as they had already been held for a month, the court decided that they would remain in custody.

Rights group Amnesty International earlier criticised the legal process and called the trial ""a sham”.

Last month, it called for investigations into the killings during the protests.

Demonstrations in all major Nigerian cities began on 1 August with people chanting slogans such as “we are hungry"" and ""end bad governance”.

The protests, organised through social media, were in part inspired by the success of demonstrators in Kenya who forced the government to scrap plans to increase taxes.

In some parts of the country curfews were imposed. The authorities said the protests had been ""hijacked by thugs"" who engaged in widespread looting and the destruction of property.

Nigeria is experiencing its worst economic crisis in a generation. Annual inflation stands at more than 30%. Food prices have risen even faster - for example, in the commercial hub, Lagos, yams, a staple food, are almost four times more expensive than last year."

Russia has fired a barrage of missiles at Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, hours before thousands of children returned to school for the first day of the academic year. The mayor, Vitali Klitschko, says a water treatment plant and the entrance of a metro station used as a shelter were hit. Two schools and a university were also damaged. According to Ukraine’s military, 22 cruise and air ballistic missiles were destroyed by the air force. Local authorities say three people were injured by debris from destroyed missiles.

For schoolchildren across the capital, Monday's bombardment coincided with the first day of the school year, a day of celebration in Ukraine. Teachers and parents tried to keep a sense of normality, with music playing while smiling students were welcomed by a sea of flowers. One parent, who hid with her daughter at home during the missile attack before taking her to school, said they were showing once more ""that this nation is invincible"". “Children are smiling, but you can see the strain on the faces of their teachers [who] carry this burden”, she told the BBC. “I’m so thankful to them for all they did to make it a real holiday for the kids."" For 33-year-old Yevheniia, who was taking her six-year-old daughter to school for the first time, the day was marred by fear. “Her hands were shaking,” Yevheniia told the Reuters news agency. “Our apartment started to stink of smoke, but we still need to go to school, right? We are Ukrainians,” she said she told her daughter that morning. Alina, a student at the damaged university, told Ukrainian TV she “started screaming” when the air raid alert sounded, with everyone running into their dormitory's bomb shelter. Air raid sirens rang out for nearly two hours during the attack, before the skies were deemed clear by the military. “We were very scared,” Alina said, adding they saw a fire following the sound of explosions.

Following the attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the first day of school ""one of the most important days of the year"" for children, and their families and teachers. ""All our schools, all higher education institutions that are working today are proof of the resilience of our people and the strength of Ukraine,” he said on his Telegram channel. All of Ukraine was placed on alert for several hours, and neighbouring Nato state Poland said it had deployed its own as well as allied aircraft to secure its airspace during the Russian strikes.

Whale dubbed a Russian spy found dead off Norway,Unknown,,"Russian 'spy whale' found dead off Norway

The tame beluga whale made the waters off Norway's coast his home

This sparked rumours the mammal could be a spy whale - something experts say happened in the past. Moscow never responded to the allegations.

The whale was first spotted in Norwegian waters five years ago with a GoPro camera attached to a harness that read ""Equipment of St Petersburg"".

The body of the animal - nicknamed Hvaldimir - was found floating off the south-western town of Risavika and taken to the nearest port for examination.

A beluga whale suspected of having been trained as a spy by Russia has been found dead off the Norwegian coast.

Hvaldimir's lifeless body was discovered at the weekend by Marine Mind, an organisation that has tracked his movements for years.

Marine Mind founder Sebastian Strand told AFP news agency that the cause of death was unknown and that Hvaldimir's body had no obvious injuries.

""We've managed to retrieve his remains and put him in a cooled area, in preparation for a necropsy by the veterinary institute,"" he told AFP news agency.

With an estimated age of about 15, Hvaldimir was not old for a Beluga whale, whose lifespan can reach 60 years.

He first approached Norwegian boats in April 2019 near the island of Ingoya, about 415km (260 miles) from Murmansk where Russia's Northern Fleet is based.

The sighting attracted attention because belugas are rarely seen this far south of the high Arctic.

The discovery led to an investigation by Norway's domestic intelligence agency, which later said that the whale was likely to have been trained by the Russian army as he seemed accustomed to humans.

The whale became known locally as Hvaldimir, a pun on the Norwegian word for whale, ""hval"", and President Vladimir Putin.

Russia has a history of training marine mammals such as dolphins for military purposes and the Barents Observer website has identified whale pens near naval bases in the north-west area of Murmansk.

Russia has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir may have been trained by the Russian military. It has previously denied the existence of any programmes seeking to train sea mammals as spies."
US Open 2024 results: Coco Gauff's title defence ended by Emma Navarro in fourth round,Unknown,,"It was Navarro who made the brighter start, earning a break point in the opening game of the match after two double faults by Gauff in a sign of things to come.

Gauff recovered to hold, but some loose shots at 3-2 gave Navarro another break opportunity, and Gauff conceded with another double fault.

As Navarro secured the set, confidently holding to love after coming out on top of a 27-shot rally, a frustrated Gauff shrugged her shoulders and exchanged words with her coaching team.

Double faults continued to plague Gauff’s performance in the second set. Another at 3-3 offered Navarro a chance to break, which she took with a superb, dipping forehand winner down the line.

But this would signal a change in momentum as, sensing she was closing in on victory, Navarro suddenly struggled for rhythm, and Gauff immediately broke back.

Backed by the packed crowd, Gauff confidently held serve before breaking again to force a decider, cupping her ear in celebration and asking the crowd for more noise.

With the match evenly poised, it was the 20-year-old's troubles on serve which would again prove the difference, with three double faults in a single game handing Navarro the break for a 2-1 lead.

Gauff’s remaining service games were punctuated by more errors, with three more double faults gifting a match point to Navarro, before a long forehand confirmed Navarro's win.

""I fought really hard today. I just didn't take care of my serve, so that was the biggest difference,"" Gauff said.

""Mentally and emotionally I gave it my all. Of course, there were things execution-wise, where I wish I could serve better.

""I think if I would did that, it would have been a different story for me in the match."""

Getty Images More teenagers in Japan kill themselves on 1 September than on any other day

Warning: This article contains details that readers may find distressing Two people have died in the Japanese city of Yokohama after a teenage girl jumped to her death from a shopping centre, hitting a pedestrian below. The 17-year-old high school student jumped from a building in a crowded shopping district, hitting a 32-year-old woman who was out with her friends on Saturday evening. The two were immediately taken to hospital around 18:00 local time (09:00 GMT), where the girl died an hour later. The woman also died soon after. It's not clear why she might have killed herself, though more people under the age of 18 in Japan kill themselves on 1 September - just ahead of the new school term - than on any other day, according to official statistics.

Last year, 513 children took their own lives in Japan, with “school problems” cited as the most common factor. Students who don't want to return to school are known as futoko, or “people who don’t go to school.” The main reasons why these futoko avoid school include family circumstances, personal issues with friends, and bullying, according to a previous survey by the ministry of education. In recent years, authorities and media organisations have tried to raise public awareness of the challenges students face at this time of year. Japan's public broadcaster, NHK, for example, mounted a campaign on Twitter called “on the night of August 31"". The most recent incident in Yokohama mirrors a similar episode in 2020, when a 17-year-old boy jumped from the roof of a shopping centre, killing a 19-year-old female student in a busy district of Osaka. At the time, the boy was posthumously charged with manslaughter, meaning that his family owed compensation to the family of the victim he killed. However, the charge was dropped shortly afterwards. So far, the authorities have not indicated any culpability with regard to Saturday night's deaths. While Japan's suicide rate is slowly decreasing among the general population, it is rising among young Japanese people. Japan is the only G7 country where suicide is the leading cause of death for teenagers. Additional reporting by Chika Nakayama in Tokyo."

The ship sank in April 1912 after hitting an iceberg, resulting in the loss of 1,500 lives.

Is US economy better now than under Trump?,Unknown,,"Is US economy better or worse now than under Trump?

BBC

It has been a recurrent theme of this US presidential campaign - has the US economy performed better under Joe Biden or Donald Trump? “By many indicators our economy is the strongest in the world,” Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris has claimed. Trump, the Republican nominee and former president, says he created the ""greatest economy in the history of our country"", and the Biden-Harris administration has ruined it. We have looked at some key indicators to compare economic performance under the two presidencies.

US economic growth

Although the impact of Covid has made comparison difficult, both presidents can count some notable economic successes despite wages struggling to keep up with price increases in recent years. First, let's look at economic growth using Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - the value of all goods and services in the US economy. There was a dramatic collapse in this figure during Covid as many businesses shut. Following the pandemic, the economy bounced back strongly under Trump and recovered better than many other western countries. This has continued under Mr Biden, with the US producing the strongest pandemic recovery within the G7 as measured by GDP.

BBC News

But over Trump's four years in office, it was not the greatest economy in US history, as he likes to claim. Between January 2017 and January 2021, average annual growth rate was 2.3%. This period includes the slowdown and recovery of the economy as a result of the Covid pandemic. Under the Biden administration so far, this figure is 2.2% - so almost the same. There have been periods in the past when GDP growth was significantly higher than the average under both Trump and Biden, such as in the 1970s.

BBC News

Inflation

The rate at which prices are rising has been a big issue in the campaign. Prices rose significantly during the first two years under Mr Biden - hitting a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Trump has said the US has experienced “the worst inflation we've ever had”. But that's not true - inflation was last above 9% in 1981, and it has been much higher than that at several other points in US history. Inflation has now fallen to around 3% - but it remains higher than when Trump left office.

BBC News

Grocery prices, for example, increased by 13.5% over the year ending in August 2022. This was the peak under the Biden administration, and prices have stabilised somewhat since, with the cost of groceries rising by 1.1% from July 2023 to July this year. The recent trend is comparable with many other Western countries which experienced high inflation rates in 2021 and 2022, as global supply chain issues driven by Covid and the war in Ukraine contributed to rising prices. But some economists say Mr Biden’s $1.9tn (£1.5tn) American Rescue Plan, which passed in 2021, was also a factor - as the injection of cash into the economy led to prices rising further.

Employment

The Biden administration has repeatedly pointed to strong job growth as a major achievement. Before big job losses in 2020 due to Covid, in the first three years of Trump's presidency almost 6.7 million jobs were added, according to data for non-farm jobs (which covers about 80% of workers in the labour force). There's been an increase of almost 16 million jobs since the Biden administration took over in January 2021.

Mr Biden claims this is the “fastest job growth at any point of any president in all of American history”. That’s correct - if you look at the available data since records began in 1939. But his administration has benefited from a sharp rebound in economic activity as the country emerged from pandemic lockdowns. “Many of the jobs would have come back if Trump had won in 2020 - but the American Rescue Plan played a major role in the speed and aggressiveness of the labour market recovery,” says Professor Mark Strain, an economist at Georgetown University. This spending plan passed under the Biden administration in 2021 was designed to help stimulate the economy following the pandemic. Weaker than expected job growth in July led to fears of a sudden downturn in the US economy and stock markets were hit as a result, but they've since stabilised.

BBC News

Both administrations have pointed to low unemployment levels under their leadership. Prior to the pandemic, Mr Trump delivered an unemployment rate of 3.5%. As in many parts of the world, Covid lockdown measures led to soaring levels of unemployment in the US - but the unemployment levels had dropped back down to around 7% when Trump left office. Under the Biden administration unemployment continued to fall to a low of 3.4% in January 2023 - the lowest rate in more than 50 years - but it it has since ticked up to 4.3%.

Wages

In terms of wages, these did rise under Trump but at a similar rate to his predecessor Barack Obama, up until the pandemic hit. Workers’ wages increased rapidly at the start of 2020 during the Covid pandemic - but the sudden uptick in wages was linked to lower paid workers being more likely to be laid off, which raised the average wage of people who were still employed. Under Mr Biden, average weekly earnings have grown, but they have struggled to keep up with the increase in prices caused by high levels of inflation. When adjusted for inflation, average weekly wages are less than when Mr Biden came into office.

BBC News

Financial markets

The US stock market isn't necessarily a reflection of the broader economy, but many Americans have investments, so its performance holds some importance. The Dow Jones Index is a measure of the performance of 30 large companies listed on US stock exchanges.

It reached record highs during Trump’s presidency, but crashed as markets reacted to the pandemic, wiping out all the gains made under Trump. However, the financial markets recovered to above pre-pandemic levels by the time Trump left office in January 2021. They have continued to grow under Mr Biden, and although there have been recent wobbles, they have reached record levels under his administration as well."
China's mission to win African hearts with satellite TV,Unknown,,"China's mission to win African hearts with satellite TV

BBC

As African leaders gather in Beijing this week for the triennial China-Africa summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping may have one thing under his belt to boast about - satellite TV. Almost nine years ago, President Xi promised the heads of state attending the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Johannesburg that China would provide over 10,000 remote villages in 23 African countries with digital TV access. With over 9,600 villages having received satellite infrastructure, the project is now nearing completion.

The ambitious pledge, revealed during a period of warm China-Africa relations and funded by China’s aid budget, was entrusted to StarTimes, a private Chinese company already operating in several African countries. It was an apparent show of goodwill and an opportunity for China to flex its soft power in a strategically important region. As China's economy struggles and Beijing re-calibrates its Africa strategy, the BBC visited four villages in Kenya to find out if this ""soft power"" initiative had paid off.

In the village of Olasiti, about three hours’ drive west of the capital, Nairobi, Nicholas Nguku gathered his friends and family to watch Kenyan athletes running at the Paris Olympics on television. “I’m very happy to see the Olympics, which for many years we had not been able to see before we got StarTimes,” he said, speaking of the company’s installation of satellite dishes about four years ago.

He is far from the only beneficiary of StarTimes’ presence across Africa. First introduced to the continent in 2008, StarTimes is now one of the largest private digital TV providers in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 16 million subscribers. Analysts say that low pricing initially helped to secure its foothold. In Kenya, monthly digital TV packages range from 329 shillings ($2.50; £2) to 1,799 shillings ($14; £10.50). In comparison, a monthly package for DStv, owned by MultiChoice, another major player in the African digital TV market, costs between 700 and 10,500 shillings. While StarTimes partly relies on subscriptions for its core revenue, the “10,000 Villages Project” is funded by China's state–run South-South Assistance Fund. The satellite dishes all feature the StarTimes logo, Kenya’s Ministry of Information emblem, and a red “China Aid” logo. During the installation of these dishes, StarTimes representatives said that this was a ""gift"" from China, several villagers recalled.

According to Dr Angela Lewis, an academic who has written extensively on StarTimes in Africa, the project had the potential to leave a positive image of China for African audiences. Villagers under the project ostensibly received everything for free, including the infrastructure, such as a satellite dish, battery, and installation, as well as a subscription to StarTimes’ content. This was a “game-changer,” according to Dr Lewis, as remote villages in Africa previously mostly had access to choppy and unreliable analogue TV. For many, this was their first access to satellite dishes, altering the way villagers interacted with the outside world, she said. For community centres like hospitals and schools in Ainomoi village in western Kenya, subscriptions remain free. At the local clinic a digital TV in the waiting room helps patients pass the time. And at a primary school, pupils enjoy watching cartoons after school. “After we finish schoolwork, we’ll all watch cartoons together and it’s a very enjoyable and bonding experience,” said Ruth Chelang’at, an eighth-grade student at the school. However, several Kenyan households interviewed by the BBC say the free trial unexpectedly lasted only a limited amount of time. Despite its relatively cheap price, extending subscriptions was considered a significant financial burden for many. With that, the initial excitement has waned among some of the project’s beneficiaries, putting a dent in China’s push to build up goodwill. “We were all very happy when we first got the satellite dish, but it was only free for a few months, and after that we had to pay,” said Rose Chepkemoi, from Chemori village in Kericho county. “It was too much so we stopped using it.”

Without a subscription, only certain free-to-air channels, such as the Kenyan Broadcasting Cooperation, are available, according to those who no longer subscribe to StarTimes packages. During the BBC’s visit to four different villages that received StarTimes dishes from 2018 to 2020, many villagers reported stopping their use of StarTimes after the free trial ended. The chief of Ainamoi village said that many of the original 25 households who received the satellite dishes in his village opted not to subscribe. The BBC contacted StarTimes for comment on the free trials but did not receive a reply.

China’s influence extends to the content broadcast on StarTimes channels, with mixed results. Even the cheapest packages include channels like Kung Fu and Sino Drama, showcasing predominantly Chinese movies and series. In 2023, over 1,000 Chinese movies and TV shows were dubbed into local languages, Ma Shaoyong, StarTimes’ head of public relations, told local media. In Kenya’s case, in 2014, the company launched a channel called ST Swahili, dedicated to Swahili content. Among villagers who have watched Chinese shows, many said they found the programming outdated, portraying Chinese characters in a one-dimensional way, with shows often centred around stereotypical themes. A quick flick through the guide shows a plethora of dating or romance-centric shows, including a popular reality show called Hello, Mr. Right, where contestants seek to find their perfect match. The format was modelled on a similar show in China called If You Are the One. For some at least, that content is a reason to continue the subscription. Ariana Nation Ngotiek, a 21-year-old from Olasiti village, is “obsessed” with certain shows, like the Chinese series Eternal Love, which is dubbed into English. “I won’t go to sleep without watching it,” she said.

Football is the real crowd-puller

But football remains the ultimate attraction for African audiences. In 2023, for example, the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) had a record number of nearly two billion viewers globally, according to the Confederation of African Football. Aware of this business opportunity, StarTimes has heavily invested in securing broadcasting rights for football matches, including Afcon, Spain's La Liga and Germany's Bundesliga. “Sports broadcasting is where StarTimes made its name,” explained Dr Lewis. Competition is fierce, however, and SuperSport, a subsidiary of MultiChoice, reportedly pays over $200m (£152m) annually for rights to broadcast the coveted English Premier League. After French football megastar Kylian Mbappé announced he was joining Spain's Real Madrid, StarTimes seized the opportunity and erected huge billboards in Nairobi that read “Feel the full thrill of La Liga”, followed by the StarTimes logo. However, this does not work for everyone. One football fan told the BBC he would “rather enjoy the thrill of Premier League.” “The majority of Kenyans are not into La Liga, it's the English Premier League that draws the audience,” explained Levi Obonyo, a professor at Nairobi’s Daystar University.

StarTimes is trying to attract customers through its coverage of Spanish football

While China’s international-facing state broadcaster CGTN, is included in its cheapest package, unlike the BBC and CNN, it does not draw in the viewers. “Yes, we also have Chinese news, but I don’t watch it,” said Lily Ruto, a retired teacher in Kericho county. “What’s it called again? C something N? T something N?” she laughed as she shrugged her shoulders. Dr Dani Madrid-Morales, a lecturer at the University of Sheffield, echoes that StarTimes has not revolutionised the [African] news environment. Most villagers say they prefer local news channels. StarTimes understands that. In fact, with over 95% of its 5,000-strong African staff being local, according to a company spokesperson, it aims to present itself as prioritising African voices. One consultant to Chinese media companies in Africa said that StarTimes was trying to avoid a repeat of what has happened to the likes of TikTok or Huawei, whose overt Chinese-ness have attracted a high level of scrutiny in the West. Dr Lewis’ study of news stories from 2015 to 2019 reinforces this, noting that most news stories mentioning StarTimes did not reference China or China-Africa relations. The company appears careful not to overtly showcase its Chinese roots.

From talk of the town to a footnote

StarTimes as a private company has seen substantial success over the years, and the ""10,000 Villages Project"" has pushed the company to a new level of fame. However, as Beijing hosts yet another FOCAC, the image-building effect of the project that China had hoped for has failed to materialise. ""There was an attempt for the government to rebalance the information flow that would put China under a positive light, but that has not materialised,"" said Dr Madrid-Morales. ""The amount of money that has gone into this hasn’t really benefitted the Chinese government all that much."" Many villagers the BBC spoke to were mostly concerned about content and costs. As rusty as several of the satellite dishes themselves, the project, once the talk of the town, has seemingly been relegated to a footnote in China's soft-power outreach. “Yes, we know it comes from China, but it makes no difference if no-one is using it,” said Ms Chepkemoi, who has cancelled her StarTimes subscription."
Sheikh Hasina poses a Bangladesh conundrum for India,Unknown,,"India’s Bangladesh dilemma: What to do about Sheikh Hasina?

EPA Sheikh Hasina (left) was a dependable ally for India during her 15-year rule

It’s been nearly a month since former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina hurriedly landed at a military base near Delhi after a chaotic exit from her country. Ms Hasina’s dramatic ouster on 5 August followed weeks of student-led protests which spiralled into deadly, nationwide unrest. She was initially expected to stay in India for just a short period, but reports say her attempts to seek asylum in the UK, the US and the UAE have not been successful so far. Her continued presence in India has generated challenges for Delhi in developing a strong relationship with the new interim government in Dhaka. For India, Bangladesh is not just any neighbouring country. It's a strategic partner and a close ally crucial to India's border security, particularly in the north-eastern states. The two countries share a porous border 4,096km (2,545 miles) long which makes it relatively easy for armed insurgent groups from India’s north-eastern states to cross into Bangladesh for a safe haven. Sheikh Hasina: The pro-democracy icon who became an autocrat After Ms Hasina's Awami League party came to power in 2009, it cracked down on some of these ethnic militant groups. Ms Hasina also amicably settled several border disputes with India. While border security is at the core of the relationship, there are financial aspects too. During Ms Hasina's 15-year rule, trade relations and connectivity between the two countries flourished. India has gained road, river and train access via Bangladesh to transport goods to its north-eastern states. Since 2010, India has also given more than $7bn (£5.3bn) as a line of credit to Bangladesh for infrastructure and development projects. Ms Hasina’s sudden exit means that Delhi has to work hard to ensure that these gains are not lost. “It’s a setback in the sense that any turbulence in our neighbourhood is always unwanted,” says Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, a former Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka. But the former diplomat insists that Delhi will work with the interim government in Dhaka because “there is no choice” and “you can’t dictate what they do internally”.

The Indian government has wasted no time in reaching out to the interim government in Dhaka, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi holding a telephone conversation with leader Muhammad Yunus. However, it will take a while for Delhi to assuage the anger in Bangladesh over its unwavering support for Ms Hasina and her Awami League for the last 15 years. Many Bangladeshis attribute the anger against India to Delhi's swift endorsement of three controversial elections won by Ms Hasina's party amid allegations of widespread vote-rigging. With Ms Hasina’s fall, Delhi’s “neighbourhood first” policy has taken another jolt with Bangladesh joining the Maldives and Nepal in resisting any attempt at dominance by India. Analysts say that Delhi can’t afford to lose its influence in another neighbouring country if it wants to protect its status as a regional powerhouse - especially as rival China is also jostling for influence in the region. Just last year, Mohamed Muizzu won the presidency in the Maldives on the back of his very public anti-India stand. “It’s time for India to do some introspection regarding its regional policy,” says Debapriya Bhattacharya, a senior economist with the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Dhaka. Mr Bhattacharya is head of a committee appointed by the interim government to prepare a white paper on the state of Bangladesh’s economy. Delhi needs to look at whether it has adequately taken on board the perspectives of its regional partners, he says. “I am not only talking about Bangladesh, [but also] almost all other countries in the region,"" adds Mr Bhattacharya, who heads a committee appointed by the interim government to prepare a white paper on the state of Bangladesh’s economy. Can India help its special ally Bangladesh defuse the crisis? For example, in the case of Bangladesh, analysts point out that successive Indian governments have failed to engage with other opposition parties, particularly the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). “India somehow thought that the Awami League and its government are the only allies inside Bangladesh. That was a strategic blunder,” says Abdul Moyeen Khan, a senior leader of the BNP. If free and fair elections are held in Bangladesh in the coming months, BNP leaders are confident of victory. That will pose a diplomatic challenge for Delhi. There is a perceived trust deficit between India and the BNP, which is led by Begum Khaleda Zia, who had been prime minister for two terms earlier. Ms Zia, who spent most of her time in jail since 2018, has always denied corruption charges against her and has accused Ms Hasina of political vendetta. She has now been released from jail and is recovering from her illness.

Getty Images Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus has been chosen to lead Bangladesh's interim government

In the coming days, Delhi and the BNP leaders will have to find a way to work past their differences. During the previous BNP-led coalition government from 2001 to 2006, the bilateral relationship deteriorated with Delhi accusing Dhaka of harbouring insurgents from India’s north-east. During Ms Zia's rule, Hindu leaders in Bangladesh said there were a series of attacks against them - including murder, looting and rape - by Islamist parties and the BNP which began as the election results were announced in 2001. The BNP denies the charges of giving shelter to anti-Indian insurgents and also of carrying out attacks on minority Hindus in 2001. BNP leaders, including Mr Khan, say India hasn't been forthcoming in engaging with them, adding that ""now it’s time for a policy shift on the part of Delhi”. He also stresses that given India’s proximity, population, geographical size and its growing economic and military might, a party like the BNP cannot afford to make the mistake of harbouring any anti-Indian insurgents within Bangladesh. 'There is no law and order. And Hindus are being targeted again' There are other factors also behind the anger against India. India and Bangladesh share 54 rivers and the sharing of water resources is a contentious issue. The recent floods triggered by heavy rains in eastern Bangladesh are an example of how misinformation can fuel suspicions between the two countries. Following a sudden heavy downpour in the Indian state of Tripura, the excess water flowed into the Gumti river - which flows between the two countries - inundating vast areas inside the state as well as downstream in neighbouring Bangladesh. Millions of people were affected with many losing their houses, belongings and farmland. Many villagers and social media users accused India of deliberately releasing water from a dam in the night, leading to the floods.

Russia-Ukraine war: Meeting the recruits preparing for battle,Unknown,,"Meeting the Ukrainian recruits preparing for new battle

BBC

For the previous 72 hours, the menacing whirr above our heads has belonged to Russia’s suicide drones, passing over and then bearing down on their targets. Now the buzz comes from a Ukrainian unmanned aircraft which has not been sent up to kill, but to relay footage from the training ground to commanders back at base. We’ve been brought to a secret training location in the Chernihiv region where the latest army intake is being fast tracked to the battlefield in the renewed effort to blunt Moscow’s grinding advance. In the hail of machine gun fire and instructors’ commands, the most striking aspect of the scene is the age of the new recruits. Most seem to be in their 40s and 50s.

Among the grey-haired contingent, Rostyslav, whose wife and two children are waiting for him back home in the Odesa region. A month ago he was a driver. Next month he could find himself fighting on Russian soil, with Ukraine vowing to hold on to the land it seized in the Kursk region during its lightning incursion a month ago. “I think this is the right thing to do,” he says of the operation. “Look how long they’ve been on our land. We’ve been suffering for so long, we have to do something. You can't just sit there while they are capturing our territory. What will we do then? Will we become their slaves?"" The training schedule we’re witnessing reflects the accelerated programme new army joiners are undergoing as Ukraine tries to deal with the sheer mass of men Russia is committing to the frontline. The Ministry of Defence in London estimated there were 70,000 Russian casualties in Ukraine in May and June alone.

Now fighting for Ukraine, Rostyslav was a driver only last month

Under the scorching sun, the new Ukrainian recruits jump in and out of American-made armoured fighting vehicles and open fire on enemy positions. The military, anxious that the location of this training remains secret, asked to see the footage we recorded on location before this story was reported across BBC News - but did not see any scripts nor have any editorial control. In a nearby woodland, a simulated Russian attack on Ukrainian trenches is repelled while the boom of grenade target practice shudders across the plain. Two and a half years into the war, and Ukraine is desperate for more troops and brought into force a new conscription law which lowered the age of men joining from 27 to 25. Military service for women is not mandatory. The drive for younger conscripts has not hit this group of men. All the recruits we see before us have already had 30 days of basic training and today it’s more advanced care - dealing with broken bones, gunshots and catastrophic bleeding - using medical equipment sent from the UK. Light-hearted moments - a decidedly wonky tourniquet here or there - punctuate a heavy air. There’s no escaping the fact the simulated emergency care being given under shade of spruces could be carried out in grim reality in the coming weeks and months.

Most of the new recruits are older men

One soldier who’s accompanied us to the site says that if the new intake have not acquired enough fighting skills they will not be sent to the frontline. “We’re not going to send them to their deaths,” he says sharply. Still, we have heard complaints, notably from professional soldiers, that raw recruits have been sent to other fronts without adequate training and thrust prematurely into frontline combat. Ukraine is on the back foot in key parts of the battlefield at home, most notably around the strategically important city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk. But last month’s incursion into Russia has boosted morale and has added a new dimension to the war. However, Kyiv is now fighting a battle on yet another front and this is a huge personal gamble for President Zelensky. His generals have tough strategic decisions to make about where to send their new recruits. Maxim, a 30-year-old builder by trade, looks to be the most youthful of the cohort. “We need to train, train and train again. The more we train the more we will learn here. It will help us on the frontline.” Where will that be, I ask? “We are ready to defend our land either in Donbas - or Kursk,” he says proudly but with a nervous laugh.

Reuters Russian forces have been advancing on the eastern Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk

Earlier, in Ukraine’s Sumy region, we had travelled under military escort to a new Ukrainian base just a few miles away from the Russian border. Along the way, we passed whole streets blasted to pieces by previous Russian artillery fire. The civilians had long gone, and the only human life was clad in the green and driving army vehicles. As we arrive at the camp, an armoured personnel carrier (APC) fresh from the Kursk incursion roars into life and springs up backwards out of its sunken hiding place. It pivots and then speeds off through the canopy lined track, leaving a huge plume of copper-coloured dust. “The Russian soldiers who surrendered, we took as prisoners of war. The Russians who attacked us, we killed.” It’s a blunt synopsis from the Ukrainian commander who goes by the call-sign “Storm”. His 22nd Mechanised Brigade was the first to enter Russian territory and now he’s returned to tell the tale. “We went far into the Kursk region. We were alone as the forward team. We were on foreign soil and we felt like foreigners. Not in our home.” A father of five with five degrees, Storm cuts a distinctive shadow in the dense forest. A giant of a man with greying goatee and military tattoos on the skin not covered by his army fatigues and body armour. “That’s us, in there,” he says showing us a video on his phone of an APC tearing through the Russian countryside. What was it like fighting the Russians on their home soil, I ask? “I worried for myself and for my group, for my servicemen, for everyone. Of course, there was fear. “

The new joiners have already had 30 days of basic training

Like all of the Ukrainian military we met, Storm is understandably reluctant to give any operational information which may help the Russians. So when I ask if he knows how long he’ll stay on Russian territory when he returns, it is an answer predictably long on patriotism and short on specifics. “We are fulfilling an order. We'll be there as long as we are told to. If we are told to move forward, we will move forward. If they tell us to withdraw, we will withdraw.” He continues in the same vein: “If we have an order to move forward, we can get to Moscow - and we'll show what Ukraine means and what are our guys are like - real Cossacks.” It’s been reported that Ukraine sent up to 10,000 elite troops into Russia as part of its rapid advance. The Russian defence ministry claims Kyiv has suffered thousands of casualties. The head of the Ukrainian army, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, announced the Russians had now sent 30,000 troops to defend Kursk. All these figures are hard to verify. In another clandestine location, a team clambers out of a German-made Bergepanzer armoured recovery vehicle. The driver, who goes by the call sign “Producer”, is a father of two who hasn’t seen his two children for three years. They escaped to Italy with their mother in the weeks after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The unit has been using a German-made Bergepanzer armoured recovery vehicle

While we’re unable to ascertain the level of Ukrainian losses, it’s clear that Producer has been busy bringing back damaged and destroyed vehicles from inside Russia. “I want this war to come to an end,” he tells us wearily in very good English. “That’s because there is no reason for this (war). One man, Vladimir Putin, attacked our country. So what do we have to do? We must defend our home. Defending, defending, defending. But Ukraine is the smaller country.” The mismatch between Moscow and Kyiv remains a key thread of President Zelensky’s ongoing call for greater Western help. Through taking the fight into Russia, Ukraine galvanised its public but worried some allies who remain fearful of Vladimir Putin’s response and the spectre of a wider conflict. So far, President Putin has largely ignored, at least publicly, the wound inflicted on his country’s side. Ukraine says that, unlike Russia, it doesn’t have unlimited reserves of conscripts to catapult to the frontline. We saw a glimpse of the deployment dilemma with our own eyes in the locations we visited this past week. President Zelensky argues that much greater American and European assistance in air defence is more vital than ever and that permission to use foreign-made long range missiles to strike further into Russia urgently needs to be granted. Especially now that Kyiv is fighting a battle at home and abroad. As we leave the training ground, the exhausted soldiers loll on the ground - water bottle and cigarette in hand for many. Rostyslav, who longs to return to his Odesa, believes his president is absolutely right. “The Russians can reach our territory with long range weapons and we don't have such a weapon to reach their territory. We can't stand this anymore” he explains. “We would like to hit Moscow to end this dirty war. Children and civilians suffer, everyone does.” Another rocket-propelled grenade thunders across the parched training field. Next time, it won’t be a drill."
Row over Paris mayor plan to keep Olympic rings on Eiffel Tower,Unknown,,"Row over plan to keep Olympic rings on Eiffel Tower

The rings were originally expected to be removed after the Paralympics' closing ceremony

Some Parisians backed the move, but others - including heritage campaigners - said it was a bad idea and would ""defile"" the French capital's iconic monument.

""So yes, they [the rings] will stay on the Eiffel Tower,"" she added.

""The decision is up to me, and I have the agreement of the IOC [International Olympic Committee],"" she told the Ouest-France newspaper over the weekend.

Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has triggered a heated debate by saying she wants to keep the Olympic rings on the Eiffel Tower after the summer Games are over.

Anne Hidalgo said ""the French have fallen in love with Paris again""

The five rings - 29m (95ft) wide, 15m high and weighing 30 tonnes - were installed on the Eiffel Tower before the Paris Olympics opened on 26 July, and were expected to be taken down after the Paralympics' closing ceremony on 8 September.

But Ms Hidalgo said she wanted to keep the interlaced rings of blue, yellow, black, green and red, symbolising the five continents.

She added that the current rings - each one measuring 9m in diameter - were too heavy and would be replaced by a lighter version at some point.

The Socialist mayor also claimed that ""the French have fallen in love with Paris again"" during the Games, and she wanted ""this festive spirit to remain"".

Some Parisians as well as visitors to the French capital supported the mayor.

""The Eiffel Tower is very beautiful, the rings add colour. It's very nice to see it like this,"" a young woman, who identified herself as Solène, told the France Bleu website.

But Manon, a local resident, said this was ""a really bad idea"".

""It's a historic monument, why defile it with rings? It was good for the Olympics but now it's over, we can move on, maybe we should remove them and return the Eiffel Tower to how it was before,"" he told France Bleu.

Social media user Christophe Robin said Ms Hidalgo should have consulted Parisians before going ahead with her plan.

In a post on X, he reminded that the Eiffel Tower featured a Citroën advert in 1925-36.

The Eiffel Tower was built in1889 for the World's Fair. The wrought-iron lattice tower was initially heavily criticised by Parisian artists and intellectuals - but is now seen by many as the symbol of the ""City of Light"".

Ms Hidalgo, who has been running Paris since 2014, is known for her bold - and sometimes controversial - reforms.

Under her tenure, many city streets, including the banks of the river Seine, have been pedestrianised.

Last year, she won convincingly a city referendum to ban rental electric scooters. However, fewer than 8% of those eligible turned out to vote.

In February, Ms Hidalgo was again victorious after Parisians approved a steep rise in parking rates for sports utility vehicles (SUVs).

But both drivers' groups and opposition figures attacked the scheme, saying the SUV classification was misleading as many family-size cars would be affected.

France's Environment Minister Christophe Béchu said at the time that the surcharge amounted to ""punitive environmentalism"".

And just before the Paris Olympics, Ms Hidalgo and other officials went into the Seine to prove the river was safe to swim."
Málaga tourism: 'People feel the city is collapsing',Unknown,,"Málaga tourism: 'People feel the city is collapsing'

Guy Hedgecoe Kike España says with so many tourists Málaga feels like a theme park

Kike España gazes across Málaga’s Plaza de la Merced. It’s late morning and it's still a peaceful spot at this time of day - jacaranda trees fill the square, an obelisk monument sits at its centre and on the far side is the house where Pablo Picasso was born. But it’s the city’s tourists, many of whom are already gathering in the host of nearby cafés, who concern Kike. “The situation is so saturated that Málaga has really reached a turning point at which people feel that the city is collapsing,” he says. “It’s the same feeling you have when you enter a theme park,” he adds. “There is a stream of people that are consuming the city and not really inhabiting it.” Kike is an urban planner and a local activist with the Málaga Tenants’ Union, which has been campaigning for a change in how the southern Spanish city manages tourism.

The organisation led a protest in late June in which thousands of local people took to the streets to voice their concern at the negative impact that tourism is having on their city, including pushing up housing costs, gentrification and crowds. And it’s not just Málaga. Spaniards have been protesting throughout the summer for the same reasons in other major tourist destinations, including Barcelona, Alicante and the Canary and Balearic Islands. In April, a group of activists on Tenerife staged a three-week hunger strike against the building of new tourist megaprojects. In Barcelona, demonstrators fired at foreign visitors with water pistols and among the slogans daubed on their banners were: “Tourism kills the city” and “Tourists go home.” Spain first established itself as a tourist hub more than half a century ago, as northern Europeans started to flock to its coastline and islands. Today, the industry represents about 13% of Spanish GDP and, having bounced back from the Covid-19 pandemic, it is surpassing records in terms of both revenue and arrivals.

Guy Hedgecoe Spain's coastline has been attracting northern Europeans for more than 50 years

In 2023, the country received 85 million foreign visitors and more than 90 million are expected this year, putting it close behind France, the world’s most popular tourist destination. José Luis Zoreda, president of the Exceltur, a tourism industry association, prefers to talk about the amount of revenue the industry generates – €200bn (£171bn) in direct and indirect activity this year, he estimates – rather than the number of visitors. He also highlights how tourism has ensured that the Spanish economy has outperformed most of its European neighbours in the wake of Covid-19. “We have been responsible in the last few years for the most important percentage of growth of our economy,” he says. “In 2023, we were responsible for 80% of the whole GDP growth of Spain.” So the sheer size of the tourism sector and its strong growth have driven the overall expansion of the Spanish economy. But there is a growing belief that the cost of such success is too high and the wave of recent protests has created the sense of a tipping point. Many Spaniards are now convinced that the towns and cities they inhabit are catering more for visitors than for residents. “Tourism was perceived as a positive economic activity that is a huge part of our GDP, but the numbers have become so huge in terms of international arrivals that we are now seeing the negative impacts, especially in cities,” says Paco Femenia-Serra, lecturer in tourism and geography at Madrid’s Complutense University. “Tourism is competing for space and the number of people out on the streets is unbearable for many residents.”

Guy Hedgecoe Locals say tourism results in small businesses being replaced by chains

Besides making these places less pleasant, locals say tourism has also pushed many smaller businesses out of the centre of cities. In their place have come franchise restaurants, bars and shops - and prices have risen. But the most-cited problem is that of housing. Spain’s biggest tourist destinations have large numbers of short-term rental properties aimed at tourists. A recent study by El País newspaper found that several areas of Málaga had the highest proportion of Airbnb properties in Spain. A quarter of all apartments in the area around the Plaza de la Merced are dedicated to tourist rental. Owners of apartments are able to charge more for short-term rentals than they would charge longer-term tenants and this has the effect of pushing up prices across the board. Locals say it is difficult to find an apartment for less than €1,200-1,300 per month in the centre of Málaga. With the average salary in the surrounding Andalusia region at just €1,600 per month, they are being priced out of their city. “If the people of Málaga don’t have somewhere to live, who will provide services for the tourists?” asked Isabel Rodríguez, housing minister for Spain's governing Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE). Speaking at a housing forum in the city in July, she continued: “Where will the waiters who serve us a glass of wine and a plate of sardines live?” As Ms Rodríguez’s comments suggest, Spain’s political class is now starting to grapple with the tourism conundrum. Catalonia and the Balearic Islands have already introduced a “tourist tax”, charging a sliding sum of up to €4 per person per day, depending on the type of accommodation used. Palma de Mallorca has sought to limit numbers of arrivals by sea, with no more than three cruise liners allowed to dock at the city per day, only one of them carrying more than 5,000 passengers.

Dubai boycott: Why more stars might follow Macklemore's lead,Unknown,,"Will more stars boycott Dubai after rapper Macklemore?

Reuters The UAE, of which Dubai is the largest city, has been accused of arming paramilitaries in Sudan suspected of genocide

When fans saw rapper Macklemore had cancelled an upcoming gig, some of them assumed it was in solidarity with Gaza. But it wasn't. The gig was in Dubai and he had cancelled over the war in Sudan, which has already killed tens of thousands of people, left millions more hungry and triggered a humanitarian disaster. The glamorous Gulf city of Dubai is the biggest in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - which has been widely accused of funding the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), one of the warring sides in Sudan. “The crisis in Sudan is catastrophic,” Macklemore said in an Instagram post on Monday. Some food security specialists estimate up to 2.5 million people could die of starvation and illness by October. “I have to ask myself what is my intention as an artist?” continued the rapper, who rose to fame with 2012 classic Thrift Shop. “If I take the money,"" Macklemore said, ""while knowing it doesn't sit right with my spirit, how am I any different from the politicians I've been actively protesting against?” His moral stand has thrust the brutal conflict - which has garnered far less global attention than Ukraine or Gaza - into popular culture, and activists hope other artists will follow suit. “It was huge,” says an activist who has been campaigning for a ceasefire with the group London for Sudan. “In the comments there were a lot of people saying, ‘oh, my God, what's happening in Sudan?’ “I think it opened people's eyes.”

Getty Images Activists and charities hope Macklemore's decision will raise awareness of the conflict

The RSF is battling the Sudanese army for control of the country and has been accused of sexual violence, looting and ethnic cleansing in areas it controls. A Human Rights Watch report suggests the RSF may have committed genocide against non-Arabs in a city where 15,000 people are feared to have been killed, something the group denies. The RSF traces its roots to a militia, known as the Janjaweed, which were also accused of genocide 20 years ago in Sudan - an estimated 300,000 people died back then.

Evidence tying the UAE to the RSF has been mounting. During the war it emerged that the RSF had used drones which a weapons expert from Amnesty International described as the “same drones” the UAE had supplied to its allies in other conflicts, including in Ethiopia and Yemen. Experts have also seen civilian aircraft allegedly transporting weapons from the UAE to the RSF, according to a UN report presented to the Security Council earlier this year. The allegation is that the UAE is trying to gain an economic foothold in the Red Sea and profit from Sudan’s resources. The RSF controls some of Sudan’s most lucrative gold mines, located in the Darfur region.

A Swiss aid organisation alleges the Emiratis are importing billions of dollars worth of the precious metal that are smuggled out of Africa, including Sudan. And before widespread fighting broke out in the country last year, the UAE signed a deal worth $6 billion to build and operate a port, airport and economic zone on the country’s Red Sea coast. The UAE government has described the allegations over its involvement in the Sudan conflict as ""baseless and unfounded"", and meant ""to divert attention from the ongoing fighting and humanitarian catastrophe"". ""UAE reiterates its call for an immediate ceasefire in the ongoing conflict. The warring parties must stop fighting and work towards finding a peaceful solution to the conflict through dialogue,"" it said in a statement to the UN. Macklemore said on Instagram that several groups had been reaching out to him over the Sudan crisis for months.

A representative of Madaniya, an organisation for Sudanese people living in the UK, told BBC News: “A boycott by a major artist is obviously going to bring more attention to the Sudanese cause, which is great. “What would be a wonderful secondary consequence is if more people were to look into the UAE’s involvement in Sudan.” Over the next few weeks, Calvin Harris is due to give a performance in Dubai’s harbour and Sophie Ellis-Bextor has a date at the opera house. Neither replied to a request for comment.

Would a boycott change anything?

Prof Alex de Waal, an expert on Sudan based at Tufts University in Massachusetts, thinks a cultural and sporting boycott could be an effective way of targeting the regional powers accused of fuelling the war. He says the UAE and Saudi Arabia are competing for influence in Africa and are backing opposing sides in Sudan. The Emirati and Saudi embassies in London have not responded to a BBC request for comment. Prof de Waal is convinced that the Arab rivals are so economically powerful that no-one is likely to sanction them - and says that any such measures would be difficult to implement. It wouldn’t be a priority for many Western countries, he adds, which are pre-occupied with the Israel-Gaza war and tensions with Iran. But he also suggests the UAE and Saudi Arabia care greatly about their reputation on the international stage. “Cultural figures and sports figures saying ‘we're not going there’ counts for much, much more than a threat of trade sanctions or financial penalties. “I think, interestingly, the [threat to them] of soft power is much stronger, and has much greater potential, than hard power.”

Dr Crystal Murphy, a specialist on East African finance based at Chapman University in California, points towards protests against apartheid in South Africa which ultimately “rewrote political science and international relations”. She explains: “The boycotts came as a result of tonnes of public and celebrity [organising] and raising awareness of the issue, where enough people were pushing their governments. “So it can happen,” she adds. “What's the difference between Macklemore and the South Africa boycotts?” Campaigners are a long way from achieving boycotts of that scale, but are hopeful that momentum will gather after Macklemore’s move. The representative of Madaniya describes warring generals as trying to destroy the fabric of Sudanese society. But that doesn’t deter campaigners. “There’s always a hope for the Sudanese people,” the activist says. And already, some people appear to be following in Macklemore's footsteps. One commenter on his post said they'd been invited to speak at a convention in the UAE, but had now changed tack: “Your post encouraged me to research a bit more and I decided to decline the offer.”"
before Putin brought him back to Russia,Unknown,,"Russian activist speaks out in spy case after prisoner swap

Reuters Mr González's Spanish wife - seen here in 2022 with a photo of him on her phone - says he is innocent

In early August, Pablo González was taken from a prison in Poland and flown to Moscow on a plane carrying Russian deep-cover agents, hackers and a hitman for the FSB intelligence service. The group was met at the airport by a military guard, red carpet and Vladimir Putin – thanking them for their loyal service to the country. Video footage from that night in Moscow shows Mr González smiling as he shakes hands with President Putin at the foot of the plane steps. Black-bearded, with a shaven and shiny head, he’s wearing a Star Wars T-shirt that declares “Your Empire Needs You”. Known by his Russian friends as “Pablo, the Basque journalist”, the 42-year-old was part of a major prisoner swap for Westerners held in Russian jails and Russian dissidents. In the group freed by Vladimir Putin were two opposition activists Mr González was accused of spying on. He’d been arrested in Poland in 2022 for alleged espionage.

“I got my first suspicions in 2019. It just dawned on me,” Zhanna Nemtsova tells me, in the first interview she’s given about the man who spied on her. The two met in 2016 at an event about the investigation into her father’s murder. Boris Nemtsov, a staunch opponent of Vladimir Putin, had been assassinated a year earlier, right beside the Kremlin. His daughter - herself a vocal Putin critic – eventually moved to Europe for safety. That day in Strasbourg, Pablo González asked Ms Nemtsova for an interview for a newspaper in the Basque region. She refused, at first. But the journalist – Spanish, with Russian roots – gradually became something of a fixture in her circle: attending events, taping interviews, mingling. Looking back, Ms Nemtsova remembers becoming wary. “I shared my suspicions with a couple of people and they were like, ‘No, this is nonsense!’ People regard you as crazy if you bring up some things. They can think you paranoid. “But I was absolutely right.” That’s why she’s decided to speak out openly now. “I want other people to be very careful,” Zhanna Nemtsova explains. “The threat is not something you can just read in books or watch at the movies. It’s very close.”

Mr González was only formally charged with espionage a week after he left Poland, flown to Moscow as part of the August prisoner swap. By then, he’d spent well over two years locked up, awaiting trial. All along, Polish prosecutors have deflected questions about the case and the process. Intelligence sources remain tight-lipped. The Polish lawyer who first represented Mr González says he can’t comment. By the time of his arrest, Mr González had been living in Warsaw for at least three years, much of that time with his Polish girlfriend. He was a freelance journalist, working mostly for Spanish-language press. He reported from the war in Nagorno-Karabakh and travelled to Ukraine. At some point, he joined a media trip to Syria run by the Russian defence ministry, always very selective about who it takes. It was in 2022 that he was detained, briefly, in Ukraine, though the SBU security service there won’t divulge any details. Then, on 28 February, Mr González was arrested in Przemysl, eastern Poland, where he was part of the media pack covering the start of Russia’s all-out war on Ukraine. The trigger for the arrest has not been made public.

Reuters Following Mr González's 2022 arrest in Poland, there was a campaign in Spain for his release

Last year, Zhanna Nemtsova was shown evidence of Mr González’s activity as part of the criminal investigation. “I have no doubt he was a spy. I am sure, 100%,” she told me this week. Ms Nemtsova is banned by a non-disclosure agreement from sharing details of the evidence. As a result, she’s had to watch people continue to profess that Mr González is innocent. “It’s scary. We shouldn’t downplay this. These people have no moral scruples. They regard you as their enemies,” she warns, referring to Russian intelligence agents. Although Ms Nemtsova says she never trusted Mr González as a true friend, he did manage to insert himself into her circle. He was informing on the group from the start, she says. “He can be very charming, he knows how to communicate with people, make them feel at ease.” Her ex-husband, Pavel Elizarov, agrees. He and Mr González were “quite close for some period of time”. He would visit him in Spain, talk politics and do tourism. He introduced others to his friend. Ilya Yashin, another prominent activist, went to a football match with Mr González in Spain and even coat shopping. When Mr González was released in the prisoner swap, Mr Yashin was one of the trades: he’d been imprisoned in Russia for condemning the war on Ukraine. Vadim Prokhorov, the Nemtsov family lawyer, recalls another detail. “He drank like a Russian,” Mr Prokhorov told me. “He could hold his drink without falling over. We should have suspected him back then!”

We did ask to interview Mr González via his wife, who lives in Spain and has been his most avid supporter. So far, he hasn’t replied. Instead, he appeared on Kremlin-controlled television, filmed wandering through a Moscow suburb, reminiscing in perfect Russian about sledging on cardboard as a child. He was born, he explains, Pavel Rubtsov – still the name in his Russian passport. He became Pablo González when he moved to Spain with his mother in 1991. His grandfather had been evacuated to the USSR during the Spanish Civil War, so Pavel and his mother were entitled to Spanish citizenship. It all made him ideal recruitment material for Russian intelligence, but the state TV report declared that Poland had no evidence of that. “They threatened and pressured me,” Mr González says, in his extremely deep voice. “I asked, ‘What did I do?’ and they said, ‘You know.’ But I didn’t.” No-one I’ve interviewed has characterised Mr González as a Putin fan, although Zhanna Nemtsova says she and he were on “different sides of the political spectrum”. “I didn’t get any pro-Russian vibe off him,” a Polish contact said. But on Russian TV, Mr González is quite clearly excited as he describes meeting “Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin” at Vnukovo airport in Moscow. Coming down the plane steps, he says, he was “practising” all the way how to greet his president. “I wanted to be sure it was a strong, manly handshake,” Mr González explains, with a big grin.

Russia TV shows freed prisoners boarding plane after swap

The BBC has not had direct access to any of the material in this case. But we have interviewed reliable sources whose accounts, taken together, reveal that Pablo González was informing on a number of people in Europe. When he was detained, Polish investigators discovered reports detailing the movements, contacts and profiles of people ranging over several years. Russian opposition activists were one target, including those close to Zhanna Nemtsova. There’s a report on at least one Polish citizen, as well as students of a journalism summer school run by Ms Nemtsova. Investigators also found emails that Mr González had copied from a laptop he had been lent. We don’t know who these reports were sent to, but they list expenses incurred in gathering information, including transport costs. “There were a lot of details, including what they ate for lunch,” the BBC was told. In some cases, that source says, questions have been added, apparently by a superior seeking clarification or more detail. One of the reports concerns the Russian defence ministry press trip to Syria that Mr González went on, though its main focus is to criticise the ministry for poor organisation of the tour.

Reuters Vladimir Kara-Murza was among the Russian dissidents who were put on a flight to Bonn

The official charge sheet accuses Mr González of espionage - namely, providing intelligence, spreading disinformation and “conducting operational reconnaissance” for Russian military intelligence, the GRU. We don’t know what other evidence there might be, but the value of what he gathered on the Russian opposition is unclear. I was told that some reports are “sloppy” and include information taken from the internet. “Some were really wordy, with 10 pages instead of one. Probably to get more funding,” the source thought. The first part matches the comments of a close friend of Mr González who told me he was “a bit lazy”. The BBC also understands that the accuracy of the reports deteriorates notably after 2018, with fewer notes or corrections by a senior officer, or handler. It may be coincidental, but that’s when large numbers of Russian intelligence assets were expelled from Europe, after double-agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned in the British city of Salisbury. And although Russian activists who socialised with “Pablo, the Basque journalist” were shocked to learn he’d betrayed them, they doubt he had access to sensitive information. “We are not in the habit of sharing this information with anyone, as we’ve always known we could face such problems,” Zhanna Nemtsova confirms. “Everything we said to him, we’d say to anyone else in public,” opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza told me after his release as part of the same prisoner swap.

One source sought to downplay the case against Mr González, describing the contents of the reports as ""not serious"". But Ms Nemtsova – whose father was murdered in Moscow for his politics – strongly disagrees. “His words were important for the GRU [Russian military intelligence]. They might have led to serious consequences. This does not suggest that Pablo himself would do some damage. But they have other people who do this. “That’s why this is serious.” When Mr González was detained, there was a flurry of protest over accusing a journalist of espionage. The EU had significant concerns about the rule of law under the previous Polish government, while groups such as Reporters Without Borders called for Mr González to be brought to trial, allowed to defend himself against any evidence, or be set free. “I thought maybe they were mistaken about the arrest,” a Polish journalist who knew Mr González remembers his own initial doubts. “I thought maybe it was just to show the government were doing stuff about Russia.” As Mr González was never convicted, his staunchest supporters still argue that Poland has “got away” with an injustice. But most were silenced by last month’s prisoner swap and the ceremonial welcome in Moscow.

The government in Madrid has been notably quiet on the case, in public, from the start. “But that prisoner exchange, and González’s reception, are the reply to everything,” one official there told me. As she put it, it would be very odd for Vladimir Putin – crusher of the free media – to “save” a mere journalist. Weeks after Mr González was returned to Moscow, the spy scandal is still causing headaches for Ms Nemtsova. In 2018 and 2019, the foundation she set up after her father’s killing invited “Pablo, the Basque journalist” to Prague to give a lecture on war reporting. The summer school for young journalists was hosted by Charles University. Now Czech media have declared that academia has been “infiltrated”, prompting a PhD student to write a dramatic letter to the university Arts Faculty, warning that the Nemtsov Foundation may pose a security threat “to the entire Czech Republic”. The student, Aliaksandr Parshankou, suggested suspending a Russian Studies MA, supported by Ms Nemtsova’s group, pending an investigation. He told the BBC the course was “by definition a point of attraction for Putin” and called for it to carry a warning that the safety of students “cannot be guaranteed”. Ms Nemtsova calls the student’s claims “groundless and manipulative” and he admits he has no actual evidence. But the foundation is part of the legacy of Ms Nemtsova’s father and she fears the aim is to “kick us out of the faculty”."
Bangladesh disappeared: Aynaghor survivors speak out,Unknown,,"'The howls were terrifying': Imprisoned in the notorious 'House of Mirrors'

EPA Michael Chakma was snatched from a street and disappeared into a secret prison in 2019

The man who walked out into the rain in Dhaka hadn’t seen the sun in more than five years. Even on a cloudy day, his eyes struggled to adjust after half a decade locked in a dimly lit room, where his days had been spent listening to the whirr of industrial fans and the screams of the tortured. Standing on the street, he struggled to remember his sister’s telephone number. More than 200km away, that same sister was reading about the men emerging from a reported detention facility in Bangladesh’s infamous military intelligence headquarters, known as Aynaghor, or “House of Mirrors”. They were men who had allegedly been “disappeared” under the increasingly autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina - largely critics of the government who were there one day, and gone the next. But Sheikh Hasina had now fled the country, unseated by student-led protests, and these men were being released. In a remote corner of Bangladesh, the young woman staring at her computer wondered if her brother - whose funeral they had held just two years ago, after every avenue to uncover his whereabouts proved fruitless - might be among them?

Getty Images Relatives of the disappeared - like these ones - have been campaigning for years to uncover where their loved ones are

The day Michael Chakma was forcefully bundled into a car and blindfolded by a group of burly men in April 2019 in Dhaka, he thought it was the end. He had come to authorities’ attention after years of campaigning for the rights of the people of Bangladesh’s south-eastern Chittagong Hill region – a Buddhist group which makes up just 2% of Bangladesh’s 170m-strong, mostly Muslim population. He had, according to rights group Amnesty International, been staunchly vocal against abuses committed by the military in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and has campaigned for an end to military rule in the region. A day after he was abducted, he was thrown into a cell inside the House of Mirrors, a building hidden inside the compound the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) used in the capital Dhaka. It was here they gathered local and foreign intelligence, but it would become known as somewhere far more sinister. The small cell he was kept in, he said, had no windows and no sunlight, only two roaring exhaust fans. After a while “you lose the sense of time and day”, he recalls. “I used to hear the cries of other prisoners, though I could not see them, their howling was terrifying."" The cries, as he would come to know himself, came from his fellow inmates - many of whom were also being interrogated. “They would tie me to a chair and rotate it very fast. Often, they threatened to electrocute me. They asked why I was criticising Ms Hasina,” Mr Chakma says.

Outside the detention facility, for Minti Chakma the shock of her brother's disappearance was being replaced with panic. “We went to several police stations to enquire, but they said they had no information on him and he was not in their custody,” she recalls. “Months passed and we started getting panicky. My father was also getting unwell.” A massive campaign was launched to find Michael, and Minti filed a writ petition in the High Court in 2020. Nothing brought any answers. “The whole family went through a lot of trauma and agony. It was terrible not knowing the whereabouts of my brother,” she says. Then in August 2020, Michael’s father died during Covid. Some 18 months later, the family decided that Michael must have died as well. “We gave up hope,” Minti says, simply. “So as per our Buddhist tradition we decided to hold his funeral so that the soul can be freed from his body. With a heavy heart we did that. We all cried a lot.”

Getty Images Sheikh Hasina, who fled Dhaka by military helicopter on 5 August, had been in power since 2009

Rights groups in Bangladesh say they have documented about 600 cases of alleged enforced disappearances since 2009, the year Sheikh Hasina was elected. In the years that followed, Sheikh Hasina’s government would be accused of targeting their critics and dissenters in an attempt to stifle any dissent which posed a threat to their rule - an accusation she and the government always denied. Some of the so-called disappeared were eventually released or produced in court, others were found dead. Human Rights Watch says nearly 100 people remain missing. Rumours of secret prisons run by various Bangladeshi security agencies circulated among families and friends. Minti watched videos detailing the disappearances, praying her brother was in custody somewhere. But the existence of such a facility in the capital was only revealed following an investigation by Netra News in May 2022. The report found it was inside the Dhaka military encampment, right in the heart of the city. It also managed to get hold of first-hand accounts from inside the building - many of which tally with Michael’s description of being held in a cell without sunlight. The descriptions also echo those of Maroof Zaman, a former Bangladeshi ambassador to Qatar and Vietnam, who was first detained in the House of Mirrors in December 2017.

Sardar Ronie Former diplomat Maroof Zaman was fearful of the repercussions of speaking out

His interview with the BBC is one of the few times he has spoken of his 15-month ordeal: as part of his release, he agreed with officials not to speak publicly. Like others who have spoken of what happened behind the complex’s walls, he was fearful of what might happen if he did. The detainee who spoke openly to Netra News in 2022 only did so because he was no longer in Bangladesh. Maroof Zaman has only felt safe to speak out since Sheikh Hasina fled – and her government collapsed - on 5 August. He describes how he too was held in a room without sunlight, while two noisy exhaust fans drowned out any sound coming from outside. The focus of his interrogations were on the articles he had written alleging corruption at the heart of government. Why, the men wanted to know, was he writing articles alleging “unequal agreements” signed with India by Ms Hasina, that favoured Delhi. “For the first four-and-a-half months, it was like a death zone,” he says. “I was constantly beaten, kicked and threatened at gunpoint. It was unbearable, I thought only death will free me from this torture.” But unlike Michael, he was moved to a different building. “For the first time in months I heard the sound of the birds. Oh, it was so good, I cannot describe that feeling,” Maroof recounted. He was eventually released following a campaign by his daughters and supporters in late March 2019 – a month before Michael found himself thrown into a cell.

Few believe that enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings could have been carried out without the knowledge of the top leadership. But while people like Mr Chakma were languishing in secret jails for years, Ms Hasina, her ministers and her international affairs advisor Gowher Rizvi were flatly rejecting allegations of abductions. Ms Hasina’s son, Sajeed Wazed Joy, has continued to reject the allegations, instead turning the blame on “some of our law enforcement leadership [who] acted beyond the law”. “I absolutely agree that it’s completely illegal. I believe that those orders did not come from the top. I had no knowledge of this. I am shocked to hear it myself,” he told the BBC. There are those who raise their eyebrows at the denial. Alongside Michael, far higher profile people emerged from the House of Mirrors - retired brigadier Abdullahi Aman Azmi and barrister Ahmed Bin Quasem. Both had spent about eight years in secret incarceration. What is clear is that the re-emergence of people like the politicians, and Michael, shows “the urgency for the new authorities in Bangladesh to order and ensure that the security forces to disclose all places of detention and account for those who have been missing”, according to Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the UN Human Rights office in Geneva. Bangladesh’s interim government agreed: earlier this week, it established a five-member commission to investigate cases of enforced disappearances by security agencies during Ms Hasina’s rule since 2009. And those who have survived the ordeal want justice. “We want the perpetrators to be punished. All the victims and their families should be compensated,” Maroof Zaman said."
Nigeria building collapses: Why Lagos constructions keep crashing down,Unknown,,"Collapse after collapse - why Lagos buildings keep crashing down

Getty Images Local people were pictured searching for survivors in the wreckage of a building that collapsed in Lagos in 2022

A building has collapsed in Nigeria’s megacity, Lagos, once every two weeks on average so far this year. Whereas the commercial cost can be calculated, a figure can never be put on the value of the lives lost underneath the rubble. The gaps among the buildings, replaced by piles of debris, represent a failure of governance as well as giving rise to allegations of contractors trying to cut corners to save money. There are regulations, there are maintenance schedules, there are inspectors – but the system does not work. Those responsible are never held to account, and so nothing ever changes. Lagos, dubbed by one expert who spoke to the BBC as "" the building-collapse capital of Nigeria"", has seen at least 90 buildings falling down in the last 12 years, leaving more than 350 people dead, according to the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria. One of the most notorious incidents was in 2021. Sunday Femi was just metres away, in the upmarket suburb of Ikoyi, when a 21-storey block of luxury flats under construction collapsed, killing 42 people. Ikoyi collapse: Anger and frustration grow After the loud crashing sound, he was engulfed in dust. “Like many, I rushed inside trying to see if I could help some of the people trapped. Sadly I knew some of those who died and I think about it every day,” he says, reflecting on what happened nearly three years ago.

The drinks seller had been speaking to some of the construction workers moments before they entered the building site. He still works nearby and the chatter among the locals often turns to those events and the possible cause. Metal sheeting protects the site from prying eyes but mounds of broken concrete can still be seen through the gaps in the gate. Knocking on the entrance to the ill-fated compound, two fierce-looking security guards opened up and said they had instructions not to allow anybody into the premises except state government officials. Just as the place is sealed to the public so is the official investigation into the collapse – it has been sitting with the state governor since he received it in 2022. A list of recommendations has reportedly been drawn up by a panel of experts following the investigation but that also has not been made public. The BBC has repeatedly asked the Lagos state authorities to see the recommendations, and the report into the Ikoyi building collapse, but neither has been made available. The coroner, however, has had her say and in 2022 she did not hold back. In a damning judgment on the deaths, Chief Magistrate Oyetade Komolafe, attributed the building collapse to the irresponsibility and negligence of the government agencies that were supposed to approve and supervise the plans and construction. Lagos’s population is booming and is now estimated to stand at more than 20 million. As the city grows so does the demand for housing and commercial property, and it can sometimes feel like a giant building site with construction going on everywhere. Before work can begin, plans need to be approved by Lagos state’s Physical Planning Permit Agency. Then inspectors from the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) are supposed to look at the site as well as check the progress at every stage of construction. And the Standards Organisation of Nigeria should make sure that only suitable building material gets to the market. But on many occasions the procedures are not followed.

Inside the LASBCA’s offices everything appears calm - there is no sense of the urgency of the problems or challenges it faces. Spokesperson Olusegun Olaoye acknowledges the criticism but dismisses allegations that officials have been bribed to issue fake certificates and rather blames a lack of resources. “At the moment we have about 300 building inspectors and supervisors but we are looking to add to that,” he says. Experts agree that more supervisors are needed. Muhammad Danmarya, architect and construction expert, says they should number in their thousands. “Three hundred is just not right for a state like Lagos. Each local government area should have at least 100 inspectors and supervisors and Lagos has 57 of those areas,” he argues. “There’s always construction going on everywhere you look, so it’s important that inspection and supervision is going on all the time.” In the absence of that regime across the state, some less scrupulous companies are getting away with violating building codes, using sub-standard materials and employing poorly trained workers – three of the reasons cited for the high frequency of collapses. “They just come here to pick us up any time they have a job for us and pay us after we are done,” says labourer Habu Isah, who has worked on construction sites for years. “I have never undergone any training, I just learned everything on the job.” But even if violations are identified in the wake of a collapse, the state’s building agency does not take any legal action. “To my knowledge there haven’t been any prosecutions in the past as far as building collapses in Lagos are concerned,” LASBCA’s Mr Olaoye admits. “I know the statistics are worrying but there are ongoing efforts to halt the trend.”

Twenty people died after a primary school collapsed in Lagos in March 2019

Alleged political influence is a barrier to pursuing prosecutions. “If you are connected to people in power, even if you are the culprit in a building collapse case nothing will happen to you,” says a Lagos state politician, who talked to the BBC on the condition of anonymity. “We’ve seen it so many times, some of the high-profile cases have to do with structures of highly placed people and they are still roaming around freely. “In Nigeria when you are rich and connected you can avoid problems easily.” With 19 building collapses already recorded so far this year by the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, the final total is likely to be the highest in the past decade. But lessons may still go unlearnt. The head of the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria recently said that the country lacked the capacity to properly investigate what is going on. “We don’t have the expertise, the equipment, and the resources to do so,” said Prof Sadiq Abubakar. In the meantime, construction workers and others will carry on paying with their lives. Additional reporting by Andrew Gift

'A tech firm stole our voices - then cloned and sold them',Unknown,,"'A tech firm stole our voices - then cloned and sold them'

BBC Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage have filed a class action lawsuit against Lovo

The notion that artificial intelligence could one day take our jobs is a message many of us will have heard in recent years. But, for Paul Skye Lehrman, that warning has been particularly personal, chilling and unexpected: he heard his own voice deliver it. In June 2023, Paul and his partner Linnea Sage were driving near their home in New York City, listening to a podcast about the ongoing strikes in Hollywood and how artificial intelligence (AI) could affect the industry. The episode was of interest because the couple are voice-over performers and - like many other creatives - fear that human-sounding voice generators could soon be used to replace them. This particular podcast had a unique hook – they interviewed an AI-powered chat bot, equipped with text-to-speech software, to ask how it thought the use of AI would affect jobs in Hollywood. But, when it spoke, it sounded just like Mr Lehrman. ""We needed to pull the car over,"" he said. ""The irony that AI is coming for the entertainment industry, and here is my voice talking about the potential destruction of the industry, was really quite shocking."" That night they spent hours online, searching for clues until they came across the site of text-to-speech platform Lovo. Once there, Ms Sage said she found a copy of her voice as well. ""I was stunned,"" she said. ""I couldn't believe it."" ""A tech company stole our voices, made AI clones of them, and sold them possibly hundreds of thousands of times."" They have now filed a lawsuit against Lovo. The firm has not yet responded to that or the BBC's requests for comment.

Clone wars

But how was Lovo able to recreate their voices? The couple alleges it was done under false pretences. Lovo co-founder Tom Lee has previously said its voice-cloning software only needs a user to read about 50 sentences to create a faithful clone. ""We can capture the tone, the character, the style, the phonemes, and even if you have an accent, we can capture that as well,"" he told the Future Visionaries podcast in 2021. In their lawsuit, the couple set out how they say Lovo obtained just such a recording from them. They allege anonymous Lovo employees contacted them to record audio assets on Fiverr, the popular freelance talent website, where they were selling their services to provide audio for television, radio, video games, and other media. First, in 2019, Ms Sage says a user reached out asking for her to record dozens of generic sounding test radio scripts. Test recordings are often used in film and television for focus groups, internal meetings, or as placeholders for works in progress. Because they won’t be shared broadly, these recordings cost much less than audio meant for broadcast. Ms Sage says she completed the job, delivered the files, and was paid $400 (£303). About six months later, Mr Lehrman says he got a similar request to record dozens of generic sounding radio ads.

In messages the couple have shared with the BBC, the anonymous Fiverr user says the audio will be used for research into ""speech synthesis"". After asking the user to guarantee that the scripts will not be used outside their specific research project, Mr Lehrman asks what the goal of the project is. ""The scripts will not be used for anything else,"" the user says, ""and I can't yet tell you the goal, as it's a confidential work in process sorry haha"". Mr Lehrman asked if the finished files would be repurposed or used in a different order. The user says the files will be used for research purposes only. Mr Lehrman says he delivered the files and was paid $1200. The link between the anonymous user and Lovo came, they say, from Lovo itself. They shared the evidence they had found of their voices being cloned with Lovo - who replied they had done nothing wrong, pointing to the communications between them the anonymous user as evidence they engaged with the couple legally. “In our careers, we've delivered over 100,000 audio assets,” Mr Lehrman said, of their work on Fiverr over the better part of a decade. “We were able to find this needle in a haystack - they gave us this needle in a haystack.” In both cases, both Mr Lehrman and Ms Sage say they did not have a written contract, just these conversations. The BBC has not been able to verify the entirety of their conversations. The couple say the user they spoke with also appears to have deleted some messages. The BBC contacted Lovo on several occasions to request an interview with Mr Lee and to seek a response to the couple’s claims. They did not respond to any of our messages.

Gaza polio vaccine: What is polio and how will children be immunised?,Unknown,,"What is the plan to give polio vaccines to children in Gaza?

Getty Images

A series of “humanitarian pauses” to fighting in Gaza are due to begin on Sunday, to allow hundreds of thousands of children to be vaccinated against polio. The agreement comes after UN officials said a 10-month-old has been partially paralysed after contracting Gaza’s first recorded case of polio in 25 years.

What is polio and how does it spread?

Polio is a serious and highly infectious disease that largely affects children under five. It is caused by a virus that spreads very easily through contact with the faeces (poo) of an infected person or, less commonly, through contaminated water or food. Most people with the infection have no symptoms but some will have: a high temperature

sore throat

headache

neck stiffness

aching muscles

stomach pain

nausea One in 200 infections lead to more serious problems, when the virus invades the brain and nervous system. This can causes irreversible paralysis, usually of the legs. It can happen within a matter of hours and some 5 to 10% of the people who are paralysed die because their breathing muscles become immobilised.

Why is polio back in Gaza?

AFP

Humanitarian groups say the virus has re-emerged because the war between Israel and Hamas has disrupted regular child vaccination programmes. It has also caused massive damage to water and sanitation systems. The WHO says immunisation rates in Gaza and the occupied West Bank were optimal before the conflict. In 2022, polio vaccine coverage was estimated at 99% for two doses of vaccine. However, this has dropped to less than 90%, according to the latest data.

What is the plan to vaccinate children in Gaza?

The aim is to vaccinate some 640,000 children under the age of 10, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. The roll-out will start in central Gaza on Sunday, with three consecutive daily pauses in fighting between 6am and 3pm local time. It will then move to southern Gaza, where there will be another three-day pause, followed by northern Gaza. According to UN officials, children who get the vaccine will need a second dose in late September. Healthcare workers aim to achieve 95% vaccine coverage across the strip, the level needed to stop transmission of the virus within Gaza. If this is not achieved there is an agreement for an additional humanitarian pause to allow a fourth day of vaccination. About 1.3m doses of the novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) are already in Gaza, with 400,000 extra doses set to arrive soon. Vaccinations will be carried out by UN staff and other local health workers. More than 2,000 health and community outreach workers have been trained to give the vaccine. Vaccines will be available in hospitals, field hospitals and primary health centres. According to the WHO, safe transport and refrigeration of the vaccines are crucial to the plan.

Where else in the world is polio found?

Poliovirus cases have fallen dramatically since 1988, when a global polio eradication initiative was launched. Many countries have not had cases of polio in many years. But in two countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan, polio is still endemic, which means it has a constant presence. There have also been outbreaks of poliovirus variants - strains related to the oral vaccine - in more than 30 countries around the world, particularly in areas where immunisation rates are low. They include Chad, Cote d’Ivoire, DR Congo, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, Algeria, Angola, Indonesia. The WHO says as long as a single child remains infected, children in all countries are at risk of getting polio, because the virus can easily be imported into a polio-free country.

"Weather tracker: extreme heat hits Brazil, fuelling risk of wildfires",Unknown,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"Unrelenting heat will continue across parts of Brazil this week with temperatures about 5C to 10C above the 1991 to 2020 average.

Daytime temperatures will reach 35C to 40C in parts of the Central West region, affecting cities such as Belo Horizonte, Brasília and Manaus. This extreme heat is likely to continue into next week, with temperatures above 40C possible in places.

This heat will amplify the risk of wildfires that have been raging across parts of Brazil, especially across the Amazon rainforest, Cerrado savanna, Pantanal wetlands and the southern state of São Paulo. Local reports say these fires have been exacerbated by high temperatures, strong winds and low relative humidity, with São Paulo and the Amazon suffering the worst fire season in decades.

Over the past week, 2,700 fires have ripped through São Paulo state, and authorities say more than 59,000 hectares (146,000 acres) have been destroyed by the fires. Brazil’s largest sugar group, Raizen SA, has estimated that about 1.8tn tonnes of its sugarcane have been affected by the fires, about 2% of its total forecasted crop for the year.

People in the region have been reporting coughs, a burning sensation at the back of their throats, and reddening of their eyes from smoke in the area.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there have been 53,620 fire spots in the Amazon between 1 January and 27 August this year – an 83% increase on the same period last year.

Parts of Africa will experience anomalously high rainfall totals from heavy showers and thunderstorms through this week. Extending from the far west including countries such as Sierra Leone and Guinea to the east, including Sudan and Eritrea, up to 100mm of rainfall is expected widely by Friday, including in parts of the Sahara.

However, closer to 150 to 200mm is possible more locally, particularly across northern Mali, Niger and northern Nigeria. The northern half of Mali usually receives less than 200mm of rainfall annually, so could get half a year’s worth of rain this week alone.

Already, at least 170 people have been killed and nearly 2,000 injured across Nigeria owing to flooding-related incidents in the past two weeks. At least 60 people have been killed after a dam burst in Sudan. Floods in Niger, Chad and Burkina Faso have also caused significant damage."
South African beauty queen crowned Miss Nigeria after nationality row,Unknown,2024-09-01 00:00:00,"A former Miss South Africa contestant hounded over a nationality row was crowned Miss Universe Nigeria on Saturday, bringing to an end a difficult few weeks for the contender.

Born to a Nigerian father in South Africa, 23-year-old Chidimma Adetshina withdrew from the country’s competition “for the safety and wellbeing of my family” after a backlash that exposed anti-foreigner sentiment in South Africa.

“This journey has been a tough journey for me … I am so proud of myself and I’m really grateful for the love and the support,” Adetshina told AFP minutes after being crowned in Nigeria’s commercial capital, Lagos. “This is something that I’ve always wanted, and I’m really glad that I have a second shot as well at achieving it.”

Her Nigerian heritage attracted vicious xenophobic attacks and sparked controversy when she was announced as a Miss South Africa finalist in July, while the government said it was investigating a claim that her mother may have stolen the identity of a South African woman.

Even though she had not been in the country for 20 years, organisers of the Nigerian contest invited her to join their final, saying it was a chance for her to “represent your father’s native land on an international stage”.

“We all need to stop with the xenophobia … with the tribalism,” first runner-up Paula Ezendu told AFP. “We’re all one family. We’re all human beings.”

Adetshina insisted she loved South Africa despite the nationality controversy and was grateful for the support from the country.

She will represent Nigeria at the international Miss Universe competition in November. “I know we are going to win,” she told reporters."
African nations hit by mpox still waiting for vaccines – despite promises by the west,Kaamil Ahmed,2024-09-01 00:00:00,"None of the African countries affected by the outbreak of a new variant of mpox have received any of the promised vaccine, pushing back a rollout that had been planned for last week.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been at the centre of an outbreak of the new clade 1b variant, with 18,000 suspected cases and 629 deaths this year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The variant has also been found in Burundi, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Sweden and Thailand.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that the first doses should arrive in the DRC “within days” but similar statements were recently made regarding donated shots from the US, which did not materialise on time.

There has been no coordinated response, with Spain pledging as many as 500,000 doses while France and Germany have promised 100,000 each and the US said it will donate 50,000. None of the pledges have so far been delivered.

The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said on Wednesday that the $245m (£187m) it had requested to tackle the outbreak was only 10% funded.

Despite mpox being first identified in humans in the DRC in 1970, African nations vulnerable to its spread are reliant on donations of vaccines from the stockpiles of richer nations.

Dr Dimie Ogoina, an infectious disease physician at the Niger Delta University teaching hospital, said neglect both internationally and by African governments meant that, decades after mpox was first identified, there were still not enough vaccines or even treatments available to the affected countries.

He said it was only during the global outbreak in 2022, which saw the virus spread to Europe and North America, that there was a wider international reaction to the disease.

Ogoina said it was important for African countries themselves to invest in protecting against diseases such as mpox to ensure they are not reliant on donors.

“The manufacturers are not based in Africa,” he said. “They tend to favour, knowingly or unknowingly, the global north. So if there’s a list of people to procure, Africa is always last in the list, and we are always the last to get supplies.”

The WHO declared a public health emergency in mid-August in response to the spread of clade 1b, a recently identified variant that spreads through close physical contact, including sexual contact but also within households.

Concern has been raised about high numbers of children dying, with a mortality rate of up to 8% for under-15s, according to the WHO. The latest update from Africa CDC on Tuesday showed a sharp rise in cases of almost 4,000, compared with 1,200 the previous week.

Last week, civil society groups published a letter to Gavi, the global vaccine alliance, urging it to push for lower pricing of the vaccine produced by pharmaceutical company Bavarian Nordic, which currently costs between $50 and $75 a dose.

“The continuously unfolding injustice of mpox owes to long indifference and inequity, stigma, slowness, anaemic use of public power and yes, greed,” said Peter Maybarduk, access-to-medicines director at US-based campaign group Public Citizen, which signed the letter.

He said that while the US government had invested in the development of the Jynneos vaccine used against mpox, the production and “outrageously high” prices were now being controlled by Bavarian Nordic.

Victorine de Milliano, policy adviser at Médecins Sans Frontières’s wing for campaigning for fair medical treatment, MSF Access, said there was a “systematic issue” that meant that lower-income countries struggle to access medical tools in public health emergencies, which was highlighted during the Covid pandemic, when richer countries were able to stockpile vaccines, tests and treatments.

“It’s a real feeling of deja vu. You would have thought that we would draw some lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic, but we see the same patterns again,” she said. “Low- and middle-income countries are also now reliant on those donations from high-income countries who do have access to the vaccines. And we also see a vaccine monopoly, [where they are] sold to the highest bidder.”

Bavarian Nordic has told Africa CDC that it can provide 2m doses this year if it gets approval for orders, allowing it to reallocate resources from other production lines.

A spokesperson for the company told the Guardian it had donated 55,000 doses and would provide an update when an agreement was made to start delivering more widely.

The company also said it was open to using tiered pricing so that countries with smaller economies would be charged less as well as those who were able to order more vaccines and over longer periods of time.

Ogoina said there were promising signs of political leaders in Africa showing vigilance in response to the public health emergency and discussing how they can invest in tackling it, as well as pledges of support from outside the continent, but it would have to be sustained.

“[There have been] a lot of commitments, pronouncements, promises, but what happens after three months? What happens after six months? What happens after one year? Will people still be interested, or will they lose interest?” he asked."
US and UN call for talks in Libyan dispute over control of central bank,Patrick Wintour,2024-08-28 00:00:00,"A crisis in the Libyan economy sparked by an escalating and sometimes violent contest over the control of the country’s central bank can only be cured through diplomacy, the US embassy in Libya has said, as it backed efforts by the UN to convene an emergency meeting of the groups involved.

The embassy, led by the ambassador Richard Norland, pleaded with all sides to heed a UN call to hold talks, saying the contest over the administration of the bank “undermines confidence in Libya’s economic and financial stability in the eyes of Libyan citizens and the international community, and increases the likelihood of harmful confrontation”.

The embassy added: “Reports of arbitrary arrest and intimidation of central bank employees are particularly concerning – those responsible must be held strictly accountable.”

There was no sign on Tuesday that the UN-backed institutions in the west of Libya, led by Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, were backing down over their dismissal of the bank’s governor of the past 20 years and installation of a new leadership.

The bank dominates the Libyan economy, owning the two main commercial banks as well as holding $27bn in reserves, most of it from oil revenues. Sadiq al-Kabir, the sacked governor, has recently started to attack Dbeibah’s overspending and is now seen to favour the forces in the country’s east.

Abdel Fattah Ghaffar, the new interim deputy governor appointed by the Tripoli-based government, held a press conference in the capital and insisted he could ease the current liquidity crisis, pay unpaid salaries within two days and be accountable to a board of governors.

He called on Kabir to hand over the secret codes that would make payments possible, revealing the extent to which the practical contest for control of the bank’s operations is in reality far from resolved.

Kabir has run the bank since 2011, the year that Col Muammar Gaddafi was toppled with western backing, leading to a paralysing split between the west and east of the country.

The rival eastern administration has opposed Kabir’s sacking and said on Tuesday it would continue with “suspending all oil production and exports until Kabir is reappointed”, citing “force majeure”. The oilfields affected constitute about 90% of the country’s oilfields and terminals.

The eastern-based administration linked its move to “repeated attacks on the leaders, employees and administrations of the central bank” and blamed “outlaw groups”.

Kabir said on Tuesday for a second day running the bank had been unable to operate due to threats from militia and the kidnapping of four staff, leading him to warn that August salaries may not be payable. His statement said the bank’s ability to send emails had been stopped illegally by those trying to overthrow the bank’s leadership.

Libya’s latest descent into chaos and fragmentation is part of a near decade-long contest over state resources within a divided Libyan political elite that has repeatedly shelved nationwide elections since 2014, fearing that democracy may lead them to lose privileged access to Libya’s massive oil revenues.

In recent months Kabir has become openly critical of the Tripoli-based government’s spending excesses, saying the profligacy was increasing pressure on the exchange rate and boosting inflation. Dbeibah has hit back, rejecting claims of resource mismanagement and corruption.

In an attempt to justify the dismissal of Kabir against the wishes of the US and European diplomats, the Libyan Presidential Council – linked to Dbeibah and headed by Mohamed al-Menfi – said it understood the concern but it believed the decision strengthened the rule of law and would lead to the appointment of a governor with integrity and competence.

It said it would also ensure that a board of directors is formed for the first time in many years, ending Kabir’s one-man show. Menfi said the council had the constitutional right to dismiss the governor, a widely contested claim that only underscores the extent to which Libya’s political institutions need renewal.

The man originally appointed as the replacement governor, Mohamed al-Shukri, has now refused to take on the role unless his appointment is also sanctioned by the eastern-based parliament, the House of Representatives.

He said: “My professional and career history and my ethics absolutely do not allow me to be part of this chaos. By God, a single drop of our children’s blood is more precious to me than all the spoils of the world and the jobs of the Libyan state. Oh God, I am innocent of what the oppressors are doing.”

The west, including the IMF, has had concerns about the central bank’s lack of accountability for years, but is opposed to the unilateral manner of Kabir’s removal, fearing that it will slow the process of unification. The British ambassador to Libya, Martin Longden, denounced “unilateral decisions that only destabilise the country” and stressed the UK’s “support for a solution through legal means and not exposing Libya’s financial situation internationally to danger”."
"Flood surge in Sudan bursts dam, destroying villages and killing dozens",Unknown,2024-08-26 00:00:00,"Surging waters have burst through a dam in eastern Sudan, wiping out at least 20 villages and leaving at least 30 people dead but probably many more, the UN has said, devastating a region already reeling from months of civil war.

Torrential rains caused floods that on Sunday overwhelmed the Arbaat dam, which is 25 miles (40km) north of Port Sudan, the de facto national capital and base for the government, diplomats, aid agencies and hundreds of thousands of displaced people.

“The area is unrecognisable,” Omar Eissa Haroun, head of the water authority for Red Sea state, said in a WhatsApp message to staff. “The electricity and water pipes are destroyed.”

One first responder said that between 150 and 200 people were missing. He said he had seen the bodies of goldminers and pieces of their equipment wrecked in the deluge, and likened the disaster to the devastation in the eastern Libyan city of Derna in September last year when storm waters burst dams, swept away buildings and killed thousands.

On the road to Arbaat on Monday a Reuters reporter saw people burying a man and covering his grave with driftwood to try to prevent it from being washed away in mudslides.

The homes of about 50,000 people were affected by the flooding, the UN said, citing local authorities, adding that the number only accounted for the area west of the dam as the area east was inaccessible.

The dam was the main source of water for Port Sudan, which is home to the country’s main Red Sea port and working airport, and receives most of the country’s much-needed aid deliveries.

Officials said the dam had started crumbling and silt had been building during days of heavy rain that had come much earlier than usual. Sudan’s dams, roads and bridges were already in disrepair before the war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces began in April 2023.

Both sides have since funnelled the bulk of their resources into the conflict, leaving infrastructure badly neglected.

Some people had fled their flooded homes and headed to the mountains where they were now stranded, the health ministry said.

On Monday, the government’s rainy season taskforce said 132 people had been killed in floods across the country, up from 68 two weeks ago. At least 118,000 people have been displaced by the rains this year, according to UN agencies."
Macklemore cancels Dubai show to protest UAE role in Sudan civil war,Unknown,2024-08-26 00:00:00,"Macklemore has cancelled an upcoming October concert in Dubai over the United Arab Emirates’ role “in the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis” in Sudan through its reported support of the paramilitary force that has been fighting government troops there.

The announcement by the US rapper reignited attention to the UAE’s role in the war gripping the African nation. While the UAE repeatedly has denied arming the Rapid Support Forces and supporting its leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, UN experts reported “credible” evidence in January that the Emirates sent weapons to the RSF several times a week from northern Chad.

Sudan plunged into chaos in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions including Darfur. Estimates suggest more than 18,800 people have been killed in the fighting, while more than 10 million have fled their homes. Hundreds of thousands are on the brink of famine.

At a contentious UN security council meeting in June, Sudan’s embattled government directly accused the UAE of arming the RSF, and an Emirati diplomat angrily told his counterpart to stop “grandstanding”. The UAE has been a part of ongoing peace talks to end the fighting.

The Emirati foreign ministry offered no immediate comment on Macklemore’s public statement on Sunday, nor did the city-state’s Dubai Media Office. Organisers last week announced the show had been cancelled and refunds would be issued, without offering an explanation for the cancellation.

In a post on Saturday on Instagram, Grammy-winner Macklemore said he had a series of people “asking me to cancel the show in solidarity with the people of Sudan and to boycott doing business in the UAE for the role they are playing in the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis”.

Macklemore said he reconsidered the show in part over his recent, public support of Palestinians amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war raging in the Gaza Strip. He recently has begun performing a song called Hind’s Hall, in honour of a young girl named Hind Rajab, who was killed in Gaza by Israeli forces, along with her four cousins, her aunt and uncle and two paramedics.

“I know that this will probably jeopardise my future shows in the area, and I truly hate letting any of my fans down,” he wrote. “I was really excited too. But until the UAE stops arming and funding the RSF I will not perform there.”

He added: “I have no judgment against other artists performing in the UAE. But I do ask the question to my peers scheduled to play in Dubai: If we used our platforms to mobilize collective liberation, what could we accomplish?”

The RSF formed out of the Janjaweed fighters under the then Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, who ruled the country for three decades before being overthrown during a popular uprising in 2019. He is wanted by the international criminal court on charges of genocide and other crimes during the conflict in Darfur in the 2000s.

Dubai has tried to draw A-list performers in the city-state at a brand-new arena and other venues. However, performers in the past have acknowledged the difficulties in performing in the UAE, a hereditarily ruled federation of seven sheikhdoms in which speech is tightly controlled.

That includes the US comedian Dave Chappelle, who drew attention in May in Abu Dhabi when he referred to the Israel-Hamas war as a “genocide” and joked about the UAE’s vast surveillance apparatus."
Venezuela judge issues arrest warrant for opposition leader after disputed election,Tom Phillips,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"A Venezuelan judge on Monday issued an arrest warrant for Edmundo González, the opposition politician widely believed to have beaten President Nicolás Maduro in the recent election, for alleged crimes that could see him spend the rest of his life behind bars if convicted.

González, a 75-year-old retired diplomat, was catapulted into the eye of Venezuela’s political storm earlier this year when he agreed to challenge Maduro in the 28 July presidential election in the place of the banned opposition leader María Corina Machado.

Maduro subsequently claimed victory, without providing proof and in spite of a growing body of evidence suggesting the unpopular authoritarian actually suffered a heavy defeat because of public anger over an economic collapse that has seen millions flee abroad.

Countries including Brazil, Colombia, Mexico have refused to accept Maduro’s claim without the publication of detailed evidence while the EU last week declared the Venezuelan strongman had “no democratic legitimacy as president.”

On Monday evening, the political crisis took another dramatic turn as it emerged that the public prosecutor’s office had asked for González to be arrested for alleged crimes including criminal association, which carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years, and conspiracy, which can be punished with a 16-year sentence.

The signed request, which was published on the public prosecutor’s Instagram account, was made to a judge from a special anti-terrorism court by the prosecutor Luis Ernesto Dueñez Reyes.

Machado, the well-known opposition leader in whose place González ran, denounced the decision, accusing Venezuela’s administration of having “lost all sense of reality”.

“By threatening the president-elect, all they do is unite us further and increase support for Edmundo González among Venezuelans and in the world,” she added on social media, calling for opposition supporters to remain serene.

In an interview with the Guardian on the eve of July’s election, González vowed to build a country of prosperity, democracy and peace if he won the election. Instead, the South American country has been plunged into a moment of profound uncertainty and apprehension.

More than 1,700 people have been detained in the wake of two days of street protests sparked by Maduro’s disputed claim to have won. Maduro has given no hint he is prepared to relinquish power in the lead up to the 10 January inauguration of Venezuela’s next president and has accused Machado and González of being part of a “fascist” foreign plot to topple him.

On Sunday, human rights groups said at least 86 teenagers who were arrested during the government crackdown had been released but hundreds of prisoners have reportedly been taken to high security prisons where they are facing terrorism charges. Several key allies of Machado and González, including one of her closest confidants, the lawyer Perkins Rocha, have been captured by secret police.

González, whom Maduro’s new hard-line interior minister has publicly called a terrorist “rat”, has not been seen in public in recent weeks and his whereabouts is unknown. Machado has also gone into hiding although she has continued to appear at occasional opposition protests."
US seizes Nicolás Maduro’s jet and flies it to Florida,Edward Helmore,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"US authorities have seized Nicolás Maduro’s plane in an apparent escalation of pressure on the Venezuelan president, more than a month after his widely contested claim of victory in the country’s national elections.

US authorities confirmed on Monday they had seized Maduro’s jet in the Dominican Republic after determining it was allegedly purchased in violation of US sanctions. The plane, described by US officials as Venezuela’s equivalent to Air Force One, has been flown to Fort Lauderdale in Florida.

“This morning, the justice department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13m [£10m] through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by Nicolás Maduro and his cronies,” the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, said in a statement.

The assistant secretary for export enforcement, Matthew Axelrod, of the Department of Commerce, said: “Let this seizure send a clear message: aircraft illegally acquired from the United States for the benefit of sanctioned Venezuelan officials cannot just fly off into the sunset.

“It doesn’t matter how fancy the private jet or how powerful the officials, we will work relentlessly with our partners here and across the globe to identify and return any aircraft illegally smuggled outside of the United States.”

The plane, a French-built Dassault Falcon 900EX with blue and red stripes and a white body, is registered in the European republic of San Marino, according to the Miami Herald. It had been in the Dominican Republic in recent months but has previously been used by Maduro for trips to St Vincent and the Grenadines, Cuba and Brazil.

Venezuela’s government said the plane’s “illegal” confiscation “cannot be considered anything apart from piracy”.

Caracas accused the US of using its economic and military power to intimidate and pressure countries such as the Dominican Republic into being “accomplices in its criminal acts”.

The seizure comes four days after the US again called on Venezuelan authorities to produce evidence proving that Maduro was the winner over the opposition candidate Edmundo González in the 28 July vote.

Washington has said there is “overwhelming evidence” that González received the most votes but Venezuelan election authorities have declined to release polling numbers, prompting unrest and a government crackdown during which more than 1,600 people have been detained.

The US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said on Thursday: “In spite of repeated calls from Venezuelans and the international community, the Maduro-controlled national electoral council has failed to substantiate its announced results by producing original tally sheets, as it did following the 2013 and 2018 elections.”

US authorities will pursue forfeiture of the plane, according to CNN. The move comes amid a broader effort to disrupt the flow of billions of dollars to the Maduro regime via judgments, seizures and the liquidation of bank accounts.

In March 2020, Maduro and 14 current or former Venezuelan officials were charged with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking. The US state department has also offered a reward of up to $15m for information leading to Maduro’s arrest or conviction.

The confiscation of the plane follows an incident earlier this year when a Venezuelan Boeing 747 cargo plane was seized in Argentina and flown to Florida. Maduro went on national television and claimed that the “evil capitalist empire” did not really want the plane, it just did not want Venezuela to have it. He said proof of that was that it was soon destroyed by “the vengeful perverse gringo empire”."
Shock as police chief taken off Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips murder case,Tom Phillips,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"Indigenous activists and lawyers in Brazil have voiced shock and dismay after the federal police chief leading the investigation into the murders of Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips was unexpectedly removed from the case.

Francisco Badenes, an experienced investigator, had been running the inquiry into the 2022 deaths of the Brazilian Indigenous expert and the British journalist since the second half of that year.

Pereira and Phillips were ambushed and killed near the Amazon town of Atalaia do Norte while returning from a reporting trip to the entrance of one of Brazil’s largest Indigenous territories.

Badenes was also responsible for investigating the 2019 murder of Maxciel Pereira dos Santos, an officer from the Indigenous protection agency Funai who had worked with Pereira and was killed in the nearby border city Tabatinga.

Late last month, for reasons that remain unclear, the Brasília-based investigator was taken off both cases, as well as a third scrutinising a 2020 massacre allegedly perpetrated by military police officers in another part of the Amazon.

Eliesio Marubo, a lawyer for Univaja, the Indigenous association where Pereira worked, said removing Badenes from those cases was “a big step backwards”. He feared it would hinder police investigations and efforts to combat the organised crime network suspected of committing those crimes and others.

“This is prejudicial [to the inquiry] … There needs to be a public interest justification for changing him – and I don’t see any kind of public interest justification here,” said Marubo, who was Pereira’s friend.

Thais Rego Monteiro, a lawyer who represents Santos’s family, said they were “dismayed, saddened and disheartened” by reports that Badenes – who has spent much of the last 30 years investigating murders and death squads – had been removed.

Monteiro, who did not know the reasons for the change, called Badenes a diligent, skilful and efficient investigator who had made significant breakthroughs in the Santos case after years of inaction. “[Relatives] feel downcast and really troubled at this change,” Monteiro said, calling it “an impediment to the advance and the conclusion of this investigation”.

The federal police declined to make an official comment on the changes. However, a federal police source confirmed a new investigator would take charge of the three inquiries and said they hoped the change would speed up the investigations into the murders of Phillips, Pereira and Santos.

In a statement, Univaja voiced “deep concern” over the situation and said there was “intense suspicion” over the unexplained move. The group, which is based in Atalaia do Norte, has asked the justice ministry for an urgent clarification.

Pereira and Phillips were killed while journeying along the Itaquaí River early on 5 June 2022. They had been visiting Indigenous patrol teams. These are trying to protect the Javari valley Indigenous territory, a vast expanse of rainforest reputedly containing the world’s largest concentration of isolated peoples.

The alleged murderers – a trio of fishers called Amarildo da Costa de Oliveira, Oseney da Costa de Oliveira and Jeferson da Silva Lima (also known as Pelado da Dinha) – are being held in custody in high-security prisons and are expected to face trial next year. They are suspected of committing the crime on behalf of Ruben Dario da Silva Villar, whom police have accused of running a transnational illegal fishing network that preys on those protected Indigenous lands. Villar has also been arrested and charged.

Amarildo da Costa de Oliveira and Jeferson da Silva Lima confessed to the murders in the days after Pereira and Phillips disappeared but later claimed they had acted in “self-defence” after being shot at by the Indigenous expert. Their co-accused have denied involvement in the crime.

However, Indigenous activists suspect an even bigger conspiracy could lie behind the killings of Phillips, Pereira and Santos and say criminal groups continue to operate in the remote region where they were murdered.

Marubo, who hoped Badenes would be reinstated, said he feared replacing the investigator would hamper efforts to catch the criminals responsible for the murders and for illegal poaching, drug trafficking and mining in the Javari.

“This will really make the investigation take a different course to the course that we believe will lead to the true culprits – not just for the murders of Bruno and Dom, but Maxciel too,” he said."
X goes offline in Brazil after Elon Musk’s refusal to comply with local laws,Tom Phillips,2024-08-31 00:00:00,"One of the world’s most popular social networks, X, has gone offline in Brazil – the country with the fifth largest digital population – after Elon Musk’s refusal to comply with local laws meant it was blocked by the supreme court.

Millions of Brazilian X users found themselves unable to access the network on Saturday morning as internet providers and mobile phone companies began to enforce the ban.

When the Guardian tried to access the network on its computer and mobile phone, it received a message reading: “Seems like you lost connectivity. We’ll keep retrying.”

Large numbers of Brazilians sought shelter on the rival network, Bluesky, which reported that it had gained 500,000 users in the past two days. “Welcome to Bluesky!” the company posted to its new adherents in Portuguese.

Bluesky’s new members included Felipe Neto, one of Brazil’s top social media influencers with more than 17 million X followers. “Don’t forget, when you go to another country, you’re obliged to follow its legislation, even if you disagree with it,” Neto wrote.

The banning of X, which has more than 22 million users in Brazil, is the climax of a politically charged, months-long arm wrestle between the country’s top court and the rightwing tech billionaire.

Alexandre de Moraes, the influential supreme court judge responsible for the ban, had been spearheading an attempt to force X to purge anti-democratic, far-right voices in the wake of the January 2023 uprising in the capital, Brasília, carried out by supporters of the former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro.

Musk, who has aligned himself with rightwing figures including Bolsonaro and his US ally Donald Trump, pushed back, accusing Moraes of squelching free speech and trying to censor conservative views. Musk’s public attacks on Moraes – many of them infantile and vulgar – were reminiscent of his repeated online digs at the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, during the recent far-right UK riots, which X’s owner was accused of inflaming.

The final straw before X’s blocking in Brazil came on Thursday, when Musk ignored a 24-hour deadline to name a new legal representative after the social media platform closed its local office in mid-August. In Friday’s ruling ordering the ban, Moraes accused X of treating the social network “like a no man’s land – a veritable land without law” by allowing the “massive propagation” of misinformation, hate speech and anti-democratic attacks.

Hours later, at shortly after midnight local time, Brazilian users began noticing that X had expired.

Musk ramped up his attacks on Moraes, calling the judge “Voldemort” and tweeting a meme of a dog dangling its scrotum in the face of another animal.

“He is a dictator and a fraud, not a justice,” Musk wrote on X, although Brazilian users could no longer read his words without using a virtual private network (VPN).

Prominent rightwing voices rallied to Musk’s side, underlining the growing affinity between the Brazilian far right and the world’s richest person.

“I’m going to radicalise, even it I do it on my own,” vowed Nikolas Ferreira, a prominent rightwing congressman, in the hours before X was blocked. “You are a freedom fighter,” Musk replied.

Progressive Brazilians scoffed at Musk’s claim to be defending free speech, with many celebrating the supreme court’s decision to show X’s owner that he was not above the law.

“If billionaires want to have companies that make billions in these parts, they need to learn to respect the laws. Long live the rule of law and national sovereignty,” the leftwing congresswoman Erika Hilton wrote on X late on Friday night.

In a second valedictory message, posted about half an hour before the ban came into force, Hilton announced she had relocated to Bluesky. “See you there soon,” she wrote."
Brazilian court orders suspension of Elon Musk’s X after it missed deadline,Tiago Rogero,2024-08-30 00:00:00,"The Brazilian supreme court has ordered that X be suspended in the country after the social media platform failed to meet a deadline to appoint a legal representative in the country.

Late on Friday afternoon, Justice Alexandre de Moraes – who has been engaged in a dispute with X’s owner, Elon Musk, since April – ordered the “immediate, complete and total suspension of X’s operations” in the country, “until all court orders … are complied with, fines are duly paid, and a new legal representative for the company is appointed in the country”.

He gave Brazil’s National Telecommunications Agency 24 hours to enforce the decision. Once notified, the agency must pass the order on to the more than 20,000 broadband internet providers in the country, each of which must block X.

In an interview with the TV channel Globonews, the agency’s president, Carlos Manuel Baigorri, said the order had already been passed on to internet providers.

“Since we’re talking about more than 20,000 companies, each will have its own implementation time, but … we expect that probably over the weekend all companies will be able to implement the block,” he said.

Justice Moraes also initially summoned Apple and Google to “implement technological barriers to prevent the use of the X app by users of the iOS and Android systems” and to block the use of virtual private network (VPN) applications.

However, later in the evening, the judge removed the part mentioning Apple and Google “until there is a statement from the parties [X and Musk] in the case, to avoid any potential unnecessary disruptions to third-party companies [Apple and Google]”.

The decision imposes a daily fine of R$50,000 (£6,800) on individuals and companies that attempt to continue using X via VPN.

The deadline given to X to appoint a new legal representative in the country expired at 8.07pm local time on Thursday (0.07am BST on Friday). An hour later, Elon Musk’s social network announced that it would not comply.

Musk responded on Friday by posting on X that Brazil was “shutting down the #1 source of truth” and that its “oppressive regime” was “so afraid of the people learning the truth that they will bankrupt anyone who tries”.

The dispute began in April, when Moraes ordered the suspension of dozens of accounts for allegedly spreading disinformation – a request Musk denounced as censorship.

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said in a radio interview on Friday morning: “Just because the guy [Musk] has a lot of money, doesn’t mean they can disrespect you … who does he think he is?”

X, formerly known as Twitter, has been without a legal representative in Brazil since 17 August, when Musk announced that his company was shutting down its operations in the country “effective immediately” due to what it called “censorship orders” from Moraes. The service has remained available to users in the country.

Moraes’ April order to X to block some accounts stemmed from an investigation into “digital militias” who backed former president Jair Bolsonaro’s attempts to stay in power after his 2022 election defeat. After Musk refused to comply, the judge included him in his investigation.

On Wednesday, Moraes gave the company 24 hours to appoint a new legal representative in Brazil – a requirement for foreign companies operating in the country – “under penalty of immediate suspension of the social network’s activities”.

In the post announcing its non-compliance with the order, X said it “would not comply with his [Moraes’] illegal orders to censor his political opponents”.

Asked on Friday about Musk’s refusal to comply, Lula said: “Any and all citizens from anywhere in the world who have investments in Brazil are subject to the Brazilian constitution and Brazilian laws.”

The president said Musk “must respect the decision of the Brazilian supreme court … If not, this country will never be sovereign”.

It was also revealed on Thursday that on 18 August – a day after Musk announced the end of X’s operations in Brazil – Moraes blocked the local bank accounts for Musk’s satellite and internet provider Starlink. The aim was to enforce fines imposed on X – as of this Friday, R$18.3m (£2.5m) – for refusing to remove profiles accused of promoting anti-democratic acts and false news.

The two firms are part of Musk’s sprawling business empire, which includes the rocket company SpaceX and the electric car company Tesla. The billionaire owns X and 40% of SpaceX and is the chief executive of Tesla.

Legal experts have criticised the Starlink decision. They argue that it is a different company (albeit one owned by the same person) and should not be held responsible for matters pertaining to X.

In an email to its clients, Starlink criticised the decision and stated: “Although this illegal request may affect our ability to receive your monthly payment … we will continue to provide services to you free of charge, if necessary.”

Starlink, which is the dominant internet provider in the Amazon, remains operational for now.

On Friday, Starlink filed a request with the supreme court to have Moraes’ decision suspended and its bank accounts unfrozen, or, if this request was denied, that the freeze be limited to the total of the fines against X. There is no indication as to when the request will be reviewed."
Severe turbulence injures seven people on United Airlines flight from Cancun,Unknown,2024-08-30 00:00:00,"Severe turbulence caused injuries to seven people on a United Airlines flight from Cancun in Mexico to Chicago and forced an emergency landing in Memphis, according to the airline.

The Boeing 737 was hit by the rough weather and forced to land on Wednesday in the latest such incident to hit the industry. One person was taken to hospital.

“United flight 1196 diverted to Memphis … after encountering a brief period of severe turbulence while the seatbelt sign was on … Paramedics met the aircraft at the gate and transported one passenger to the hospital,” the airline said in a statement.

In May a Singapore Airlines flight saw one passenger killed and 71 people injured after encountering severe turbulence. The plane dropped 54 meters in altitude in less than five seconds and diverted to Bangkok for an emergency landing.

Though such injuries are rare, experts believe severe turbulence might be becoming a more serious and frequent threat in the face of the global climate crisis and changing weather patterns. A study by the University of Reading reported that incidents of severe turbulence jumped by 55% over the past four decades as more extreme weather has become more common."
"Pope arrives in Indonesia, the first stop on longest tour of his papacy",Unknown,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Pope Francis, 87, landed in Muslim-majority Indonesia on Tuesday for a visit dominated by inter-faith ties, at the start of an ambitious four-nation tour that will be the longest of his papacy.

The pontiff left Rome on Monday afternoon and landed in Jakarta just before midday Indonesian time, the first stop in a 12-day voyage that will also take in Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore.

Covering about 32,000km (almost 20,000 miles), the tour – the longest and farthest of his 11 years leading the worldwide Catholic church – will test Francis’s increasingly fragile health. In recent weeks the pontiff has appeared in good spirits.

Catholics represent fewer than 3% of the population of Indonesia, or about eight million people, compared with the 87%, or 242 million, who are Muslim. In the officially secular country, Catholicism is one of six officially recognised religions or denominations, also including Protestantism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Confucianism.

On Thursday, Francis will meet representatives of all six at Istiqlal mosque, the largest in south-east Asia and a symbol of religious coexistence. It is linked via a “tunnel of friendship” to the cathedral across the road, where Christians in recent days have been taking selfies with a lifesize cutout of the pope.

At the mosque, Pope Francis will sign a joint declaration with the grand imam, Nasaruddin Umar.

The statement will focus on “dehumanisation”, notably the spread of violence and conflict, particularly to women and children, as well as environmental degradation, according to the Indonesian bishops’ conference.

The pope has repeatedly urged the world to do more to combat climate change and mitigate its effects – including rising sea levels, which threaten the heavily polluted megalopolis of Jakarta.

Security is tight for the three-day visit, with the military, police and members of the president’s own detail among more than 4,000 law enforcement officers deployed.

A billboard declaring “Welcome Pope Francis” has been put up in central Jakarta, while the government has ordered a special stamp in his honour.

The country’s religious affairs ministry has hailed the visit as a symbol of Indonesia’s religious diversity.

“It is very important in conveying a message and showing the world that religious harmony in Indonesia is guaranteed and has been implemented,” ministry spokesman Sunanto, who goes by one name, said on Monday, according to state news agency Antara.

It is the third papal visit to Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,500 islands, after Paul VI in 1970 and John Paul II in 1989.

Despite Indonesia’s official recognition of different faiths, there are concerns about growing discrimination, including against Christians, with local Catholics hoping the pope will speak out.

Michel Chambon, a theologian and anthropologist at the National University of Singapore, said the pope would be pressing a wider message he has already delivered in other Muslim-majority countries, from Iraq to Bahrain, Turkey and Morocco.

The visit “is not really aimed at Catholics in Indonesia” but is intended to highlight the global importance of Islamic-Christian dialogue, he told AFP.

Francis will meet the outgoing president, Joko Widodo, during his visit and hold meetings with young people, diplomats and clergy. He will also preside over a mass in an 80,000-seat stadium, one of several such events during the tour, the 45th overseas trip of his papacy.

Originally planned for 2020 but postponed due to the Covid pandemic, the visit takes place three months before his 88th birthday.

The pope has come to routinely use a wheelchair to move around, underwent hernia surgery in 2023 and has been plagued by respiratory issues.

He has not travelled abroad since visiting Marseille in France in September 2023, having cancelled a planned address at UN climate talks in Dubai two months later.

He will be travelling to Indonesia with his personal doctor and two nurses, but Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said that was normal and no extra precautions were in place."
"If China wants Taiwan it should also reclaim land from Russia, says president",Helen Davidson,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"If the Chinese Communist party truly believes it has a territorial claim to Taiwan, then it should also be trying to take back land from Russia, Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, has said.

Lai made the remark in an interview to local media on Sunday, noting Beijing’s very different approach to two similar historical moments of territorial loss.

Under the rule of Xi Jinping, the CCP claims Taiwan is a Chinese province run by illegal separatists, and he has vowed to annex Taiwan under what it calls “reunification”.

Beijing says Taiwan has been part of China since “ancient times” but was taken by Japan during the “century of humiliation”, the period between 1839 and 1949 during which China was repeatedly subject to defeat and subjugation. Complete restoration of China’s losses in that time is a driving narrative of the CCP, and today is largely focused on Taiwan.

However, Lai, who was elected president in January, noted that China also lost land to Russia during that period but was not making any effort to take it back. He said this showed Beijing’s plans to annex Taiwan – which it has not ruled out using force to achieve – were not driven by territorial integrity.

“If it is for the sake of territorial integrity, why doesn’t it take back the lands occupied by Russia that were signed over in the treaty of Aigun? Russia is now at its weakest, right?” he said, referencing an 1858 treaty in which Russia annexed about 1m sq km of Chinese territory, including Haishengwei – today known as Vladivostok.

“You can ask Russia (for the land back) but you don’t. So it’s obvious they don’t want to invade Taiwan for territorial reasons,” Lai said.

He said Beijing’s true motivations were geopolitical, wanting to change the world order in its favour. Taiwan is a major island in the first island chain of the Pacific, and control would give the CCP highly strategic access and passage, as well as increased control of the Taiwan strait.

Wen-ti Sung, a China analyst at the Australian National University, said the treaty of Aigun was China’s most humiliating defeat of the 20th century, in terms of total land area lost, but noted that Chinese officials had repeatedly attended Russian economic forums in Vladivostok, “thereby conferring legitimacy to Russian rule over the territory”.

“If the driver of Chinese ambition towards Taiwan is to bring the ‘century of humiliation’ to a complete end then you’d expect China to prioritise taking back from Russia the land lost in the treaty of Aigun,” Sung said.

“But Beijing is not, and barely ever talks about it, let alone gets anywhere near talk that it will recover those territories ‘by force if necessary’.”

The Qing, China’s largest and last imperial dynasty, signed over Taiwan to Japan in 1895 in another “unequal” treaty, and in 1945 at the end of the second world war it was handed over to the Republic of China government, which fled China in 1949 after being defeated by the Communists in the Chinese civil war, establishing an authoritarian government in exile on Taiwan.

Taiwan transitioned to democracy in the late 1980s, and is one of Asia’s most vibrant. Its elected government says Taiwan is a sovereign nation and that its future is for its people, not the CCP, to decide.

China’s government is yet to respond to Lai’s remarks.

North Korean table tennis players may be punished for Olympic podium selfie with rivals from South,Justin Mccurry,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"For most observers, it was proof of sport’s ability, if only for a fleeting moment, to bring people together – even when they live on opposite sides of one of the world’s most heavily armed borders.

But one of the most celebrated images of the Paris Olympics – a selfie taken by medal-winning table tennis players from either side of the divided Korean peninsula – appears to have landed the North Korea duo in trouble back home.

In a rare moment of Korean-style ping-pong diplomacy, the South Korean mixed doubles players Lim Jong-hoon and Shin Yu-bin and the North Korean pairing Kim Kum-yong and Ri Jong-sik beamed as they posed for a selfie on the podium after receiving their bronze and silver medals at the South Paris Arena last month. The Chinese gold medallists, Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha, also appear in the photos.

One of the images was posted to the Games’ official Instagram site, where it drew hundreds of thousands of likes, while People magazine named it as one of the Olympics’ top 12 moments of sportsmanship in Paris.

But this week media reports claimed that Kim and Ri had been placed under “ideological scrutiny”. The Daily NK, a North Korea-focused website based in Seoul, quoted a high-ranking source in Pyongyang as saying that athletes and members of the North Korean Olympic Committee had been undergoing a month-long “ideological scrubbing” since returning home in mid-August – reportedly standard procedure for sportsmen and women who have been exposed to life outside the communist state.

The website reported the country’s athletes had been instructed not to interact with fellow competitors from other countries, including the South, and were warned that “fraternisers” could face punishment.

The table tennis players were reportedly singled out for criticism in a report submitted to officials for “grinning” as they posed alongside athletes from a country the regime has described as its “number one enemy”.

The selfie was snapped at a time of heightened tensions between the two Koreas, whose 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce but not a peace treaty. The North recently protested against joint military exercises involving the South Korean, US and Japanese forces, while growing cooperation between the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and Russian president Vladimir Putin have caused alarm across the region.

It isn’t clear what, if any, sanctions the table tennis players could face. That, the Korea Times suggested, could depend on how much remorse they show for momentarily lowering their guard in Paris.

North Korean athletes returning from international competitions undergo a three-stage “ideological review” that ends with self-reflection sessions by team members, in which they are expected to criticise “inappropriate behaviour” among their teammates, as well as reflecting on their own actions, the Korea Times said.

The newspaper quoted a source as saying that heartfelt expressions of contrition can spare athletes “political or administrative punishments”, the nature of which is unclear.

Human Rights Watch said the reports “demonstrate the North Korean government’s efforts to control behaviour beyond its borders.

“The International Olympic Committee … has a responsibility to protect athletes from all forms of harassment and abuse, as set out in the Olympic Charter,” it said in a statement. “North Korean athletes should not fear retribution for actions at the Games, not least when their actions embody the values of respect and friendship, on which the Olympic movement is built.”

While Kim and Ri won a silver medal, other athletes have reportedly been punished for underperforming.

The Daily NK cited the case of the North Korean football team, who were knocked out of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa after losing all three of their group games and conceding 12 goals.

The players were reportedly subjected to a six-hour excoriation for “betraying” the communist nation’s ideological struggle, while their coach, Kim Jung-hun, was forced to work on a building site."
Pope Francis to set off on challenging 12-day Asia-Pacific tour,Ashifa Kassam,2024-09-01 00:00:00,"Pope Francis is to embark on the longest, farthest and perhaps most challenging trip of his pontificate as he begins a 12-day Asia-Pacific tour that is expected to highlight environmental threats, emphasise interfaith dialogue and reinforce the importance of Asia for the Catholic church.

The 87-year-old will set off on Monday on a tour taking in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore, a trip that will clock up more than 20,000 miles by air.

Originally planned for 2020 but postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, the visit is being seen as a nod to the importance of Asia, one of the few places where the church is growing in terms of baptised faithful and religious vocations.

Francis is scheduled to headline more than 40 events during the ambitious tour. “It is a show of strength for Pope Francis,” Massimo Faggioli, an Italian academic, told Reuters.

Shihoko Goto, the director of the Indo-Pacific Program at Washington’s Wilson Center, said the visit, coming as the pontiff struggles with health problems, “speaks volumes about the strategic importance of Asia for the church”.

Francis’s first stop will be Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country. Francis will visit Jakarta’s main mosque and is expected to tour a singular feature built in 2020 as a symbol of religious harmony: an underground “Tunnel of Friendship” that links the mosque to the country’s Catholic cathedral.

He will be accompanied by the grand imam, Nasaruddin Umar, and both are scheduled to later take part in an interfaith gathering. Francis, who in 2019 became the first pope to visit the Arabian peninsula, has long signalled that Catholic-Muslim dialogue is a priority.

The pope is also scheduled to meet Indonesia’s outgoing president, Joko Widodo, and to hold a mass for an estimated 80,000 people at a Jakarta stadium, an Indonesian church official told the Associated Press.

In Papua New Guinea, Francis will meet missionaries from his native Argentina. It is believed he will use the stop to address the threat of climate change, citing challenges such as rising sea levels and increasingly severe heatwaves and typhoons.

He will then head to East Timor to celebrate mass on the same seaside esplanade where Pope John Paul II offered a liturgy in 1989. The former pontiff was later credited with helping to cast a global spotlight on Indonesia’s brutal occupation.

Home to an overwhelmingly Catholic population, East Timor may force Francis to confront the clergy sexual abuse scandal. In 2022, the Vatican confirmed that it had imposed sanctions on the bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, an East Timor independence hero, after allegations that he sexually abused young boys during the 1990s.

There is no word on whether Francis’s visit will include any reference to Belo, who remains revered for his efforts to win East Timor independence from Indonesian rule.

The pontiff’s last stop will be Singapore, where three-quarters of the population trace their roots to China. Analysts described the stop as part of the Vatican’s efforts to improve its ties with China, home to an estimated 12 million Catholics.

Last week the Vatican reported its “satisfaction” that China had officially recognised the Tianjin bishop, Melchior Shi Hongzhen, whom the Vatican installed in 2019. The Holy See described China’s official recognition of him under civil law as “a positive fruit of the dialogue established over the years between the Holy See and the Chinese government”.

Search for tourist swallowed by sinkhole in Kuala Lumpur stalls amid safety fears,Unknown,2024-08-31 00:00:00,"The search for an Indian tourist who was swallowed by a sinkhole in Malaysia’s capital has stalled after being deemed “too risky”.

Vijaya Lakshmi Gali was walking along a road in Kuala Lumpur on 23 August when the pavement beneath her suddenly collapsed. She plunged into an 8-metre-deep (26ft) sinkhole and disappeared. Rescuers have found no trace of her so far except for her slippers.

The search operation has involved tracker dogs, remote cameras and ground-penetrating radar.

As the search entered its eighth day on Saturday, the country’s fire and rescue department said it was too dangerous to send down divers, according to the Straits Times.

“There are various factors for halting the operation, which include the safety and health of the rescue personnel,” said Dr Zaliha Mustafa, a minister in the prime minister’s department.

Searchers have flushed portions of the underground drainage system using high-pressure water jets and excavators to remove debris.



Two divers entered early on Thursday but it was too dangerous and they were pulled out before they could reach the obstacle.

Authorities said a soil slip was also reported in the same location last year. A second sinkhole appeared on Wednesday about 50 metres from where the woman disappeared, causing concern over public safety. Some roads in the area have been closed.



Maimunah Mohd Sharif, the mayor of Kuala Lumpur, has reassured the public of the city’s safety. She said a taskforce has been formed to inspect sewage pipes and assess the safety of structures in the surrounding area.



Police said Gali came to Malaysia with her husband and friends about two months ago for a holiday. The accident occurred a day before they were due to return home."
Last-minute Taiwan drama and a policing plan: five things we learned at the Pacific Islands Forum,Daniel Hurst,2024-08-31 00:00:00,"1. Policing plan gets the nod, with fine print Under the new Pacific Policing Initiative, a multinational police unit will be established to respond quickly to a natural disaster or to provide security for major events. It includes plans to establish a training and coordination hub in Brisbane, Australia. In addition, police centres of excellence will be set up in four Pacific island countries, including Papua New Guinea. Australia has offered to provide $400m over five years to establish the centres. Pif leaders formally announced their support on Friday, although consensus was reached on Wednesday – a win that the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, described as “a cracker” in a jovial private conversation with the US deputy secretary of state, Kurt Campbell. Australian PM caught on camera joking with senior US official over funding of Pacific policing plan Read more The Pif communique on Friday backed the proposal but also emphasised the need for national consultations in every Pacific country on precisely how each of them would engage with the new scheme. Solomon Islands – which struck a security pact with China in 2022 – said these consultations would be important to ensure “that it’s owned and driven by countries”. Vanuatu earlier this week said the region should ensure the plan was “framed to fit our purposes and not developed to suit the geostrategic interests and geostrategic denial security postures of our big partners” – a reference to a western desire to box out China. Australia had always insisted the initiative would be Pacific-led and that no country would be compelled to participate. The region’s police chiefs will meet in Tonga next week to work on a plan for how to implement it.

2. New Caledonia fact-finding mission The unrest in New Caledonia was a key issue in discussions during the leaders’ retreat on Thursday. The French territory has seen deadly violence since May after lawmakers in Paris approved a constitutional amendment to allow recent arrivals to the territory to vote in provincial elections. It prompted fears that it would dilute the vote of the Indigenous Kanak people. and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, later announced he was suspending the change. The prime ministers of Tonga, Solomon Islands, Cook Islands and Fiji are expected to lead the delegation, with the timing yet to be announced. Tonga’s prime minister said the objectives included gathering information to “better understand the situation in New Caledonia through holding interviews and field visit with all stakeholders relevant to resolution of the crisis”. The terms of reference also call for support for ongoing efforts to achieve peace and stability, de-escalate ongoing violence and promote discussion between the parties. The fact-finding missions will provide a report with “clear recommendations” to Pif members.

3. Climate crisis takes centre stage – but fossil fuels omitted from communique The UN secretary general, António Guterres, elevated the climate crisis by attending the first couple of days of the talks and releasing two reports on sea level rise and natural disasters. ‘A crisis entirely of humanity’s making’: UN chief issues climate SOS on trip to Pacific Read more “I am in Tonga to issue a global SOS – Save Our Seas – on rising sea levels,” he said, reiterating the need for a fast and fair phase-out of fossil fuels. “If we save the Pacific, we also save ourselves.” Pacific island leaders see the climate crisis as the “the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific”. Even so, there was curiously no explicit mention of fossil fuels in the final communique. Right now, leaders are seeking to build momentum and pledges for the new Pacific Resilience Facility, a Pacific-led and “people-centred” climate and disaster fund. It is an alternative to larger, established schemes such as the Green Climate Fund. Leaders announced this week that Tonga would be where the new fund was based.

4. Amid US-China rivalry, a last-minute drama over Taiwan The intensifying contest for influence between the US and China continues to dominate headlines, although Pacific leaders have repeatedly signalled that they don’t want to be seen as pawns in a larger geopolitical struggle. The US and China are not members of Pif, but they are among its many “dialogue partners” and they routinely send high-powered delegations to build the relationship with countries in the region. Potentially sensing the mood, the US and China indicated to Pif leaders on Wednesday that they wanted to work together to address the climate crisis – an olive branch that was well received. The warmth didn’t last long: China’s special envoy for the Pacific, Qian Bo, demanded the scrapping of language about Taiwan in the final communique on Friday. The line effectively rebuffed calls to downgrade Taiwan’s status as a Pif development partner, in language that surprised some observers and angered Beijing. Just three of the 18 members of Pif still have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The communique was republished on Saturday without the offending line included. Pif leaders are yet to settle on a declaration for the Pacific as an “ocean of peace” – a proposal advanced by the prime minister of Fiji, Sitiveni Rabuka. In a nod to their impatience over the big powers’ geopolitical games, the Pif leaders said the emphasis should be on the “peace” element of the “peace and security”."

30m ago 07.22 BST Former ABC broadcaster Tim Bowden dies Tim Bowden, the former ABC radio and television broadcaster and author, has died aged 87. David Anderson, the ABC managing director, said Bowden “was for several decades one of our pre-eminent journalists and broadcasters, a storyteller whose curiosity for the world around him was valued by so many of our audiences”. Bowden was a correspondent based in Asia and North America during the 1960s and Anderson said he helped Australians understand global events. Anderson said: Tim was part of the generation of ABC journalists who brought those events and their meaning into Australian homes every night. Tim was perhaps best known as the host of much-loved ABC TV program Backchat from 1986 – 994 and for his amazing documentaries on Australian research in the Antarctic that produced footage still seen today. He received an Order of Australia for services to public broadcasting in June 1994. Tim was part of the fabric of the ABC for decades and made a huge contribution to the national public broadcaster and to the nation. He was generous to his colleagues and was known as much for his sense of humour as his passion for journalism and the ABC. Share Updated at 07.30 BST

Bennett said there were three elements he would focus on; was Higgins forced to go to Perth to keep her job? What was her involvement in activities in Perth? And what happened after the Morrison government was re-elected? Bennett said Higgins’ claims about the above points in the televised interview on The Project in February 2021 were all “false” because it “wasn’t part of the narrative she wanted to falsely portray”. The court is shown text messages between Higgins and her former boyfriend, Ben Dillaway, where Higgins describes her time in Perth as a “workcation”. On Monday, the court was shown other messages between Higgins and Dillaway during that period, where the former staffer outlined her distress.

Investigators recommend safety reforms after Brisbane air traffic controller found asleep on shift,Andrew Messenger,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Air safety investigators have recommended reforms to workplace safety after a Brisbane air traffic controller was found asleep “at the console” while covering an early-morning shift.

A report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) released on Tuesday blamed multiple consecutive night shifts and an ineffective fatigue risk management system for the incident.

The worker was discovered at 5.15am lying across two chairs with a blanket covering them on 9 December 2022, the report said.

The employee had worked their seventh night shift in nine days as a approach controller for Cairns airport from the Brisbane control centre, with the shift starting at 10pm and running until 6am.

They had completed 10 night shifts in 12 days.

The reported noted there were no planes in the area at the time and ATSB was unable to determine when the employee went to sleep.

A Brisbane Centre air traffic controller who was found asleep at their workstation towards the end of their shift had worked multiple consecutive night shifts resulting in sleep debt, an ATSB investigation report details. — ATSB (@atsbgovau) September 3, 2024

“The controller had been working multiple night shifts with reduced extended rest periods, which likely reduced their ability to obtain restorative sleep. This increased the likelihood of experiencing sleepiness and sleep onset while on duty,” ATSB found.

The report also criticised an “overreliance” on short-term changes to manage the airport roster “likely due to an underlying lack of resources within Airservices Australia”.

While no findings were made against the controller, Airservices Australia has since increased its overall number of air traffic controllers.

It has also developed additional guidance and training on the fatigue risk assessment process, including information on how low-traffic situations should be treated as high-risk.

A spokesperson for Airservices Australia said the company had “provided an extensive response to the ATSB regarding the measures we have taken as the result of our own investigation to address the two safety issues raised in their report, specifically regarding fatigue management and resourcing of rosters”.

“We will continue to refine and improve our processes based on feedback. We note the ATSB report states that they consider these measures adequately address this safety issue,” the spokesperson said.

ATSB’s chief commissioner, Angus Mitchell, said fatigue “remains one of the most relevant ongoing concerns for safe transport, despite increased awareness across the transport sector”.

“We urge transport operators to investigate fatigue events to identify and remedy deficiencies in work scheduling, fatigue risk management processes and risk controls,” he said.

California home thought to have inspired Sydney Opera House sells for US$20m less than asking price,Kelly Burke,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"An iconic California beach house thought to have inspired Jørn Utzon’s design for the Sydney Opera House has sold for US$20m less than its original asking price.

Malibu’s Wave House, designed by the American architect Harry Gesner in the late 1950s, was bought by the former Victoria’s Secret model Karlie Kloss and her venture capitalist husband, Joshua Kusher, founder of Thrive Capital, for US$29.5m last week.

The six-bedroom, 6,200-sq ft residence – with its central crested roof resembling a wave approaching the beach when viewed from the water – took more than a year to sell. It was listed with an asking price of $49.5m in June 2023.

The home’s most recent owner was Warner Bros record executive Mo Ostin, who fostered the careers of Jimi Hendrix, Prince, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Fleetwood Mac and Madonna among others. Ostin died aged 95 in 2022.

The Wave House was famously occupied by Rod Stewart throughout the 1970s, with the British pop star installing railings around the house’s expansive decks to allow him and his guests to use it as an outdoor dancefloor.

The popular hypothesis that Utzon was inspired by Gesner’s design to create the Sydney Opera House has never been proved beyond doubt. The two were designing their respective career-defining buildings at around the same time.

Gesner’s son, Zen Gesner, told the Guardian last year when the house went on the market his father and the celebrated Danish architect were certainly in contact during the late 1950s.

He recalled his father talking about a phone call he received from Utzon “out of the blue” one day.

“He complimented my father on his design of the wave house, he’d seen photos of it,” Gesner said.

“He mentioned to my father that he was working on a very unconventional design for the Sydney Opera House, and that, in a lot of ways, my father’s wave house design inspired him.

“My father was blown away by this because all architects are pretty much egomaniacs, they very rarely ever tip their hats to other people for inspiration. And this really shocked my dad, he was so humbled by this call.”

But in Gesner senior’s 2012 book, Houses of the Sundown Sea, the architect played down the link between the two building’s designs.

“I wish people would not insist that something looks like something else, but they do.” he wrote.

“It’s human nature and a bore. An inspirational concept comes from a collection of parts and pieces … and that wonderful sauce, ‘imagination’.”

Utzon won the design competition for the Sydney Opera House in 1957. Gesner’s Wave House was completed in 1963, a decade before the official opening of the Opera House in 1973."
"Brittany Higgins had ‘visceral hatred’ for Linda Reynolds and exaggerated claims to suit her narrative, court told",Sarah Basford Canales,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Brittany Higgins had “visceral hatred” towards her former employer Linda Reynolds and exaggerated how long she had to wait for counselling support following her rape allegations to “suit” her narrative, a court has heard.

In closing arguments to Western Australia’s supreme court on Tuesday, where Reynolds is suing Higgins for defamation, Reynolds’ lawyer Martin Bennett said Higgins had “trivialised” Reynolds’ hurt and distress - “arrogantly” from the “sanctity of France”.

Reynolds sued Higgins over a series of social media posts published in July 2023, which the Liberal senator alleged had damaged her reputation. But Higgins has claimed a defence of truth, saying Reynolds mishandled her 2019 rape allegation – which was made public in 2021 – and did not properly support her.

On Tuesday, Bennett dismissed the defence’s claims that Reynolds’ hurt and distress was caused by “public scrutiny”, saying it was instead due to the “deliberate defamatory conduct” by Higgins.

Bennett pointed to a text message Higgins sent to her now-husband David Sharaz, on 17 May 2021, where she wrote: “Fuck it. If they want to play hardball I’ll cry on the Project again because of this sort of mistreatment. I do not care.”

Bennett said the message showed this was “a woman who was prepared to cry again” and was further evidence of her “visceral hatred” of Reynolds.

Witness evidence over the weeks has dealt with the alleged harm Reynolds faced by the posts but has also centred on other events across the five-year period after Higgins alleged she had been raped by her then colleague Bruce Lehrmann in the then defence minister’s office in Parliament House in 2019.

Lehrmann denies raping Higgins and his criminal trial was derailed by juror misconduct. As part of Lehrmann’s failed defamation trial against Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson, a federal court in April found that, on the balance of probabilities, he raped Higgins. Lehrmann has appealed against that finding.

Bennett said on Tuesday Higgins had exaggerated her wait time for counselling support following her rape allegations to “suit” her narrative. He said Higgins was encouraged to seek employment assistance services in the week after the allegations were first revealed to the senator and Reynolds’ then chief of staff, Fiona Brown.

In her televised interview with The Project in 2021, Higgins said she was handed a brochure for those services but there was a “two-month wait” before she could receive support.

The court was shown text messages showing Higgins had been offered an appointment with the counselling service on 18 April 2019 - nearly a month after the alleged rape.

Bennett said: “It’s not the trauma of a rape victim getting it wrong, it’s on her phone ... it wouldn’t suit her purpose to correct that fact.”

Bennett also said Higgins’ claims on The Project that she had been forced to go to Perth to keep her job was “false”, and pointed to a text where Higgins described her planned time in Perth as a “workcation”.

Earlier on Tuesday, Higgins’ lawyer Rachael Young SC said her client was not trying to bring down the Morrison government or hurt Reynolds when she came forward with a rape allegation.

In her own closing arguments, Young pointed to a message exchange between the former political staffer and reporter Samantha Maiden.

The journalist asked whether Higgins thought the senator should resign after her story was published.

“Fully off the record, I don’t think so. I think she was just following instructions to be honest,” Higgins responded in a message on WhatsApp.

Young said Higgins “felt a moral responsibility” to others working in Parliament House when she came forward to publicly reveal allegations she was raped by her then colleague Lehrmann.

Young dismissed the allegation that Higgins was motivated by a desire to “hurt” Reynolds, her former boss, and to “bring down the Morrison government”.

Instead, Young said Higgins’ motivation was to “call out” her alleged perpetrator and the way she was treated after disclosing the incident, and to “achieve reform” in the parliamentary workplace.

In concluding her closing arguments, Young said the trial had heard a lot about the word “agency”.

Reynolds had said she wasn’t a “counsellor” for Higgins and had tried to give her “agency” when asked why she didn’t do a welfare check on her after they held a meeting about her rape allegations.

But Young said Higgins had “no agency” when she was allegedly raped. She had “little agency” when, as a 24-year-old, she met with Reynolds, then the defence minister, in the room where it allegedly happened just a week later.

Higgins had “no agency” when she was sent to Perth to work on the federal election campaign, away from her support networks, Young said.

Young said Higgins did, however, have agency when she decided to come forward to the media and publicly speak about her experience to achieve reform.

Young read out a statement Higgins provided the media in 2021 after the story was published.

“The prime minister has repeatedly told the parliament that I should be given ‘agency’ going forward. I don’t believe that agency was provided to me over the past two years but I seize it now. I was failed repeatedly, but I now have my voice, and I am determined to use [it] to ensure that this is never allowed to happen to another member of staff again.”

Young said: “That’s why she spoke up, that’s what she is being sued about, and that’s why we say this action should be wholly dismissed.”

It is expected the trial before Justice Paul Tottle will conclude on Wednesday."
‘Stupidity’: Tasmanian premier blasts hikers rescued from Mt Wellington after severe weather warnings,Sharlotte Thou,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Tasmanian premier Jeremy Rockcliff said it was “ridiculous” and “stupid” that a group of hikers had to be rescued from kunanyi/Mt Wellington on Monday afternoon amid a temperature that felt like -21.6C

A group of 13 hikers stuck on a hard-to-reach section of the mountain called emergency services at 4.15pm on Monday. The group set out on a day hike, having brought mobile phones but minimal food and water, and no equipment to spend the night in case of an emergency.

On the way down, at 1,100m altitude, the group, assisted by City of Hobart personnel, met another five hikers who police say were similarly unprepared, according to a statement from Tasmania police.

The temperature dropped to -3C on the mountain on Monday night, with a feels-like temperature in the wind of -21.6C, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, with heavy snowfall and wind gusts up to 109km/h.

Insp Darren Latham said it was incredibly frustrating police were forced to repeat the same warnings – especially during a severe weather event.

“The Bureau of Meteorology, the SES and Tasmania Police have been issuing warnings to the community regarding the severe weather event since last week. This included several bushwalker weather alerts,” he said.

“Bushwalkers should always prepare for the worst. Our emergency service personnel often put their own lives at risk during rescues, so it is frustrating when the situation could have been avoided,” he said.

The City of Hobart chief executive, Michael Stretton, said there was no guarantee stranded walkers could be rescued, so visiting the mountain in extreme weather conditions was highly risky.

“We can’t guarantee that we’ll always be able to rescue stranded walkers so visiting the mountain in these extreme weather conditions comes with high risk,” Stretton said.



Tasmania police Insp Kathy Bennet told ABC Radio Hobart the bushwalkers were endangering lives.



“Quite frankly, I’m gobsmacked that someone would think that it is OK to go wandering up the mountain on a day like yesterday,” she said.



“That potentially put other lives at risk because we had our search and rescue people up at New Norfolk, with the anticipated issues we had up there [for flooding response] … and we would have to think about redeploying resources to get people.



“If the road’s closed don’t walk up there, it’s as simple as that.



“Snow and low clouds are not good walking conditions especially when you have three children involved on the walk, which is what there was.”



Rockliff described the situation as “simply ridiculous” at a press conference on Tuesday.



“We cannot afford to have any resources diverted simply because of people’s stupidity of not heeding those warnings,” Rockliff said.



“Thankfully, local government supported that rescue when our SES personnel and others were out supporting other communities.”"
"Clinicians telling women their pain is ‘psychological’, Victorian inquiry hears",Unknown,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Women are being told by health professionals that their pain is a psychological or personality issue.

That’s according to Victoria’s health minister, who detailed early findings from a women’s pain inquiry that heard from 13,000 women, girls, clinicians and carers.

Participants shared instances of sexism and misogyny in healthcare and described the toll of chronic pain on their lives and experiences of being ignored, the state government said.

About 4,500 people described living with endometriosis, 3,000 with migraines and 2,500 with period pain.

The state health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, said it was clear women’s pain was not taken seriously enough, with women describing difficulties navigating both public and private health systems.

“Overwhelmingly, they told us that they’re not being listened to, and instead their pain is being attributed to either psychological or personality factors,” Thomas told reporters in the Melbourne suburb of Heidelberg on Tuesday.

“This is simply not good enough, when women are not being listened to it means that their diagnosis is not happening where and when it should.”

The report is yet to be finalised, and is due to be handed down at the end of 2024, but the minister expected recommendations to include educating clinicians about women’s health.

“To be frank, we have clinicians that don’t really understand a range of conditions that impact women’s health,” Thomas said.

“We can think about the courses, the degree courses that our healthcare professionals study, and whether or not they have sufficient focus on women’s health.

“We can think about the training that they receive on site in our hospitals and other healthcare settings and their ongoing professional development.”

The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners Victoria chair, Dr Anita Muñoz, said she was “not particularly surprised” by the early findings as they were backed up by two decades worth of academic literature.

“Women, when they’re presenting with pain, have long reported that they have difficulty being heard and understood,” Muñoz said.

“There are lots of different diagnoses made when women present with pain, particularly gynaecological and pelvic pain.”

She said the current rebate system rewarded GPs for spending “less time, not more” with patients and called for them to be eligible for paid time off to study, as in other health professions.

“Chronic pain is a bona fide medical problem that requires as much careful care as anything else,” Muñoz said.

“So I think we do need an attitudinal shift, we need time to spend with our patients and we need a greater understanding of, actually, very complex pathophysiology of pelvic pain.”"
Tuesday briefing: Why the far right’s success in German state elections can’t be written off as a local phenomenon any more,Archie Bland,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Good morning. For the first time since the second world war, a far-right party has won a regional election in Germany. As well as finishing first in Thuringia, where it won nearly 33% of the vote, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) finished second in Saxony, with 31% – and it did so with none of the normalisation strategy that similar parties have deployed in France or Italy. Instead, the AfD uses Nazi slogans and calls the Berlin Holocaust memorial a “monument of shame”.

While the AfD demanded to be included in coalition negotiations in both states yesterday, a “firewall” designed to keep the party out of government is likely to hold for the foreseeable future. Even so, its success is undoubtedly a seismic moment in German politics. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to the Guardian’s Berlin correspondent Deborah Cole about how the AFD did it, and whether this is a regional phenomenon or a signpost to something larger. Here are the headlines.

Five big stories

Israel-Gaza war | The UK has broken with the Biden administration by announcing it is suspending some arms export licences to Israel because of a “clear risk” the materiel may be used in violation of international humanitarian law. It came as Benjamin Netanyahu defied protests at home and criticism from Biden by vowing that Israel would not relinquish control over the strategic Philadelphi corridor along the Gaza-Egyptian border. Grenfell inquiry | Companies found at fault over the Grenfell tower fire are facing calls to be banned from public contracts. Ahead of the final public inquiry report’s publication tomorrow, it emerged that about £250m in deals have been made in the past five years with firms involved in the high-rise’s refurbishment. Politics | Jeremy Corbyn is to form an official parliamentary alliance with four independent MPs who were elected on pro-Gaza platforms, and has issued a call for more MPs to join. The group will have the same number of MPs as Reform UK and the Democratic Unionist party, who each have five MPs, and more than the Green party and Plaid Cymru, who each have four. France | A husband who allegedly drugged his wife and invited more than 80 strangers to rape her at their home for almost a decade will go on trial on Monday in a case that has shocked France. Fifty men accused of taking part in the abuse of the woman are also on trial at the court in Avignon. Society | Pride in Britain’s history has fallen sharply over the past decade as the country has become more reflective about its place in the modern world, according to a leading barometer of the British public mood. The proportion of people saying they were proud of Britain’s history fell from 86% to 64%.

In depth: ‘It has sent aftershocks through the country – everyone is grappling with the consequences’

News of the AfD’s success was “all-consuming” in Germany on Monday, Deborah Cole said – with the subplot of success for an upstart populist party on the left, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), providing little consolation for the mainstream parties.

The three parties in chancellor Olaf Scholz’s unpopular government, including his own centre-left Social Democrats, each received less than 10% of the vote. “Despite the fact that we’ve known all year that this election would probably look exactly like this, there is a feeling of a political earthquake,” Deborah said. “It has sent aftershocks through the country, and everyone is grappling with the consequences.”

The state elections in which the AfD has enjoyed such success confer considerable power on the victors. “The postwar constitution designed things to avoid too much power being concentrated in Berlin,” Deborah said. The states have power over areas ranging from education to policing and health care – but the regional elections are also a barometer of the wider political mood.

“In the past, there have often been attempts to dismiss strong performances at the state level as protest votes or being based on hyper-regional issues,” Deborah said. “But these two elections represent about 10% of the German population. We are out of the territory of dismissing this as a protest. For many voters now, the AfD really is their party. They have pledged their allegiance.”

How strong are the AfD?

While many parties on the far right begin on the fringes and then seek to make themselves more acceptable to the mainstream, the story of the AfD’s rise follows a very different path.

“People like Marine Le Pen [in France] and Giorgia Meloni [in Italy] have tried to put a bourgeois face on their politics,” Deborah said. “The AfD has dispensed with that. They started out as a little grouping of Eurosceptic economics professors, critical of European bailouts and feeling that Germany shouldn’t have to pay the bill for what they saw as profligate southern European countries. It was more about the euro than migration.”

But in the 11 years since its founding in 2013, the party has only become more radical with each change in leadership, with anxieties over Angela Merkel’s commitment to help refugees arriving from Syria in 2015 just one rung on the ladder. Deborah points to Björn Höcke (main picture), its leader in Thuringia, whom she recently heard speak in the state capital of Erfurt, and who is central to its radical anti-migrant, anti-Islam message.

“He has directly targeted Germany’s culture of remembrance and atonement for the Holocaust,” she said. “It’s hard to overstate how shocking that is to many Germans.” Another former AfD leader has previously dismissed the Third Reich as “no more than a speck of bird shit in over 1,000 years of successful history”.

“The scary thing is that the most successful chapters of the party are also the ones that are under observation from the German constitutional authorities and designated as rightwing extremists,” Deborah said. “Their hostility to the mainstream makes them quite thrilling to some voters, particularly in the east. So there is no obvious incentive for them to tack towards the centre.”

Who are the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance?

The other big winner on Sunday night was the BSW, which was founded only last year when Wagenknecht (above), a charismatic firebrand in hard-left politics since the 1990s, broke away from the existing Die Linke party. Her eponymous party finished third in both Thuringia and Saxony, and is now likely to form a part of any coalition government.

“The party’s name underlines how much this is a one-woman show, and she has scrambled the landscape,” Deborah said. “You can’t make light of what her party is calling for. On the one hand, it is left wing on economics, calling for higher taxes on the wealthy, for example. But Wagenknecht has also really struck a chord with views that many see as being pro-Russian, or even pro-Putin: she is strongly critical of military aid to Ukraine, and she wants immediate peace talks – which would cement Russia’s existing gains.”

Foreign affairs are not part of regional coalition negotiations, of course. “But it’s only a year until the general election,” Deborah noted. “The smart money is on the BSW at least being able to capture the five per cent of the national vote which is the hurdle to representation in parliament. So that means she could be a player in national coalition talks.”

Is this just a regional phenomenon?

Ever since the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification, the east of the country has held a distinct political identity of its own. In this excellent analysis, Philip Oltermann writes: “For years, the assumption in Germany has been that once the eastern states had ‘caught up’ with the rest of the country economically, their political outlook would align.”

Today, though, the AfD is succeeding even as more people migrate from west to east than are going the other way, with eastern states’ economies growing rapidly. “You don’t see the kind of disparity you used to,” Deborah said. “But the impact of the past is still felt. There are still big demographic differences: for example, a lot more women have left than men.”

As early as 2007, Spiegel reported that two thirds of those who had left since 1991 were women, and that the young men who stayed were prime targets for neo-Nazi groups. “A lot of the people with better education and better prospects left too. The AfD have been very good at tapping into a sense of alienation.”

Nonetheless, any attempt to dismiss these elections as a local problem should be treated with caution. “In two weeks’ time, we’ll have elections in Brandenburg [the state surrounding Berlin], and while the Social Democrats will do a bit better, we’re probably going to see similar results. This is not just a phenomenon of the east any more.”

Will the firewall hold?

The mainstream parties have said that they will maintain a brandmauer, or firewall, against the AfD, and refuse to cooperate with them on legislation or include them in coalitions. While the CDU did work with the AfD in Thuringia in 2023 to pass a property tax cut and defeat the minority government, there is little expectation of that norm collapsing now.

“You can more or less guarantee that that will be maintained in the foreseeable future,” Deborah said. “They are too far outside the mainstream. They will not enter any central government coalition.”

But there are ways that policy can work to the benefit of a party that presents itself as an anti-establishment voice. Meanwhile, even if it won’t work with the AfD, the CDU has been shifting rightwards since Angela Merkel’s retirement, in part because of the threat the AfD poses to its vote share.

After a mass stabbing allegedly carried out by a Syrian asylum seeker in the western city of Solingen in August, for example, the CDU demanded that all Afghan and Syrian refugees be stopped at the border before making an asylum claim – in defiance of the German constitution. “Yes, the AfD is going to continue to be excluded from government,” Deborah said. “But there is a strong argument that they are exercising a lot of influence already.”

The Upside

A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad

View image in fullscreen Nigerian architect Mariam Issoufou. Photograph: Courtesy of Mariam Issoufou

Mariam Issoufou never dreamed of becoming an architect. “I didn’t know of any architects in Niger, let alone any women in the field,” she says, in an interview with the Guardian’s Oliver Wainwright. However, little over a decade since leaving a career as a software engineer, Issoufou has established herself as one of Africa’s most sought-after designers.

Issoufou’s prize-winning work is defined less by a particular style and instead by a desire to utilise the best of local materials and skills, and aren’t centred in western ideas or standards. “That’s the only image of progress that we have, and unless you’re able to achieve that, you’re somehow lacking. I found that incredibly insulting,” she says. Instead, she seeks to innovate in ways tailored to the places she works in. Built with unfired earth bricks and designed around passive ventilation principles, buildings in the housing complex she designed in Niger’s capital, Niamey, are 10 degrees cooler indoors than out, while an equivalent concrete building would require air conditioning to be habitable.

AfD’s success in German elections piles pressure on a fragmented EU,Jennifer Rankin,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Alternative für Deutschland’s stunning success in Germany’s regional elections was described as “bitter” and “worrying” by chancellor Olaf Scholz. It is also concerning for the EU, which is grappling with existential problems, from Russia’s grinding war on Ukraine to the climate crisis, while at the beginning of a new five-year cycle after the European elections earlier this summer.

“A dark day for Germany is a dark day for Europe,” said French centrist MEP leader Valérie Heyer. While the results in the eastern states of Thuringia and Saxony were not a surprise after the AfD’s strong showing in June’s European parliamentary vote, they confirm the steady rise of parties once considered beyond the pale.

Radical and far-right parties are in government, or support the government, in Croatia, Finland, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Sweden. Austria could soon join that list with opinion polls showing the far-right Freedom party comfortably ahead before elections on 29 September.

Meanwhile, France remains stuck in political paralysis, nearly two months after the president, Emmanuel Macron, called snap elections in response to the victory of the far-right National Rally in the European elections. Germany’s coalition government – already seen as underpowered in Brussels – looks set to be even weaker after catastrophic results for all three governing parties in the two eastern states on Sunday.

While recent election results in Poland and Spain show nationalist and far-right forces can be defeated, the overall picture looks gloomy for the EU.

The weakness of France and Germany – the fabled motor driving European integration – in the face of the growing strength of the radical and far-right parties presents problems for the European project, which runs on compromise, respect for the rule of law and institutions.

A fragmented EU with the radical right in the ascendancy will affect the most politically momentous decisions.

Support for Ukraine will be threatened, especially as governments confront the costs of domestic rearmament, ongoing military support and Ukraine’s reconstruction.

The green agenda – entering a crucial implementation phase – will be at risk. Traditional centre-right parties, under pressure from the climate-sceptic far right, have shown they are ready to vote against ambitious policies to protect climate and nature.

Governments will also be under more pressure to curb migration – the issue that most unites radical and far-right parties.

The EU earlier this year agreed a sweeping package of laws to overhaul migration rules, including measures to speed up the return of people denied asylum, as well as share the cost of looking after people on the move. Hungary has denounced the pact, which is applicable from 2026, saying it will refuse any “mandatory solidarity” requirement to house asylum seekers, or make a financial or other contribution. If Hungary refuses, other governments could follow, pulling threads that unravel an untested system of EU cooperation.

Added nerves over Europe’s economic outlook and the soaring demands on the EU budget, which will have to be re-negotiated before 2028, the European project faces a rocky few years.

So far EU officials have sounded confident that such parties can be mostly contained or will moderate their behaviour once in office: a dynamic aided by the fact they are divided over foreign policy and how to handle Brussels. Europe’s radical and far-right forces are also splintered into three separate groups in the European parliament, blunting their effectiveness.

“The centre is holding,” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said in June, once it became clear that pro-EU parties had won the most seats in the European parliament, although radical and far-right forces significantly increased their vote share.

Sitting around the tables of EU decision-making can meanwhile draw anti-EU leaders into the traditional ways of deal-making – a “socialisation effect [that] will eventually overrule their ideological baggage”, as described by researchers at the Carnegie Europe thinktank in Brussels

Giorgia Meloni is the textbook example. The Italian prime minister has mostly taken a pragmatic, non-confrontational approach to the EU, while curbing the rights of same-sex parents and seeking greater control over the media at home. In contrast, the EU’s struggle to contain the nationalist right is exemplified by Viktor Orbán. Hungary’s long-serving leader is a serial disruptor of EU decisions, even if he usually – but not always – backs down.

If the radical and far right continue to win elections, further boosted by a Donald Trump victory in November, containment becomes harder. The EU could see more Orbán copycats, rather than those emulating Meloni’s pragmatic strategy. “The challenge of the radical right needs to be addressed more seriously,” Carnegie researchers have said."
‘It was all a blur’: Ukraine’s troops on their audacious incursion into Russia,Shaun Walker,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"On a recent morning deep in Ukrainian-occupied Russia, three soldiers from a Ukrainian special operations team jumped into their car, the back windscreen missing after being smashed out the previous day by explosives dropped from a Russian drone, and sped away in the direction of Ukraine.

Six hours later, they would be in Kyiv, together with a precious cargo of documents stashed in boxes piled on the back seat, the fruits of a four-day mission into enemy territory for the trio. The documents included Russian interior ministry papers and military orders, seized from official buildings in Sudzha, the town at the heart of Ukraine’s surprise Kursk operation, and from abandoned Russian trenches nearby.

“At the time it was all a blur, it’s only later when you come out that you realise where you’ve just been and what you’ve been doing,” said Artem, one of the three, talking at a roadside stop just hours after leaving Russian territory.

Ukraine’s incursion into Russia, now in its fourth week, was shocking in its audacity, and has laid down an unexpected challenge to the Kremlin. Suddenly, it is Russian flags that are being pulled down from administrative buildings, Russian civilians who are taking shelter as soldiers of a foreign army patrols their streets, and Russia which is scrambling to prove it has control of its own long-established borders.

Even as Ukrainian troops come under sustained pressure on other parts of the frontline, the dash into Russia has provided a much-needed morale boost inside Ukraine, after months of relentlessly bleak news.

“They’re in a desperate David versus Goliath battle and this appeals to their rebellious spirit,” said one western diplomat in Kyiv, adding that the Kursk operation had boosted the mood among the political elite immeasurably in recent weeks.

Part of the initial excitement came from sheer surprise. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and his top military commander discussed the plans in private and just a few people were brought into the circle. “Based on the experience of this war so far, the fewer people know about an operation, the more successful it will be,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, a key Zelenskiy aide, in an interview in Kyiv. “An extremely limited number of people knew ahead of time,” he added.

In Sumy, the closest Ukrainian city to the border, locals noticed the city and surrounding areas filling up with military personnel in the weeks before the incursion, but did not know why. “There aren’t many rental options in Sumy, and people were asking around looking for anywhere free where soldiers could stay. It was only later, when the operation started, that the puzzle came together,” said Dmytro Tishchenko, the CEO of cukr.city, an online portal devoted to news and culture in Sumy.

The troops themselves were also given no warning of what was to come. “We thought we were being transferred here to carry out defensive work against a possible Russian incursion,” said one soldier who has been in the area since a week before the assault began.

Ukraine claimed last week to control nearly 1,300 sq km (500 sq miles) of Russian territory, comprising 100 settlements – mostly small villages, but including the town of Sudzha, home to 5,000 people before the assault. The road from Sumy to the border remains thick with military vehicles, with soldiers riding everything from motorcycles to tanks into Russia.

In Sudzha, say Ukrainian soldiers, the streets are mostly deserted and a putrid smell hangs in the air, the result of produce rotting in the late summer sunshine. Many people fled further into Russia at the start of the offensive, but those who remain are now cut off, with no way out, no power and no mobile reception. The Ukrainian soldiers patrolling the streets are their only source of information.

“We tell them Ukrainian forces have taken the city of Kursk and are marching on Moscow, and it’s time to learn Ukrainian,” laughed one soldier who had recently been in the city. Soldiers rotate out of Sudzha with trophies – ranging from Russian flags and posters seized from official buildings to T-shirts featuring Vladimir Putin taken from stalls at Sudzha market – but say they are not inflicting the same terror that Russian occupiers wrought on Ukrainian towns.

Sudzha has now been under total Ukrainian control for a fortnight, but Russian drones remain a constant threat, and operating at the margins of the offensive can be a scary business. On one occasion, when clearing out a deserted Russian trench, Artem caught sight of what he thought was a fleeing Russian soldier. He was about to shoot when he realised someone had left a mirror in the trench, and he was seeing his own reflection. “You’re crawling through forests in the dark, and you realise that you’re absolutely alone, right inside enemy territory,” said Serhii, another member of the team.

For now, Ukraine’s forward advance appears to have stalled, but Russia has not succeeded in retaking territory either. Kyiv says it has no interest in trying to annex Russian land, but for now wants to retain control of what it has taken.

“We are not Russia, we don’t want to rewrite our constitution to add these territories … Our tasks are to push Russian artillery and other systems further away, destroy the warehouses and other military infrastructure that is there, and also to affect public opinion in Russia,” said Podolyak.

Many in Kyiv also see the incursion as a message to Ukraine’s international partners, at a time when voices suggesting that some form of negotiations may be necessary in the medium-term future are growing louder.

“Ukraine is trying to create leverage on Russia to have real negotiations, not a capitulation packaged as a negotiation,” said Alyona Getmanchuk, the founder of the New Europe Center in Kyiv.

Podolyak first denied Kyiv had one eye on future negotiations, but then added: “Russia is not a rational country. It could be forced to negotiations, but for that you need [things like] the Kursk operation.”

Getmanchuk said the operation, details of which Kyiv did not share with western partners beforehand, was also born out of frustration at repeated warnings about the risks of escalation by Washington. “The Kursk operation was a signal to forget about the supposed ‘red lines’ that Ukraine should not cross,” she said.

Another goal of the operation was to capture Russian soldiers and use them as leverage to help free some of the thousands of Ukrainians held in Russian prisons. Ukraine claims to have captured nearly 600 Russian soldiers from inside Kursk region, many of them conscripts. A week ago, Ukraine swapped 115 of them for the same number of Ukrainians held in Russia.

At a holding facility in Sumy region, Russian prisoners spoke of their shock at the war arriving to Russian territory and their unpreparedness for combat. Some had arrived in Kursk region only days or weeks before being captured. The Guardian spoke with more than a dozen Russian prisoners, who gave their consent to talk and were not monitored by prison guards while speaking, but is not quoting them directly due to international conventions around prisoners of war.

“As a citizen of Ukraine I despise them, but I treat them how I want our prisoners to be treated in Russia,” said Volodymyr, the deputy head of the facility where they are held. “If we can use them to free our guys, then I am happy,” he added.

While the Kursk operation has created a feelgood moment, there remains an acute awareness among many Ukrainian soldiers that things in the east of the country are looking increasingly bleak, as Russia steadily closes in on the city of Pokrovsk. If that advance continues, the whispered questions about whether the Kursk adventure was worth it are likely to get louder.

For now, though, the operation remains a symbol of Ukrainian success on the battlefield. “We can use it to create a buffer zone alone the border to reduce attacks on us. And at minimum, we’ve got prisoners to exchange, and have given our population something to be happy about,” said Artem."
"Two US soldiers assaulted by nationalist youth group in Turkey, authorities say",Victoria Bekiempis,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"Two US military service members were “physically attacked” in the port city of Izmir in western Turkey on Monday by members of an anti-American youth group, authorities said.

Fifteen suspected assailants were detained in the attack on the two service members, who were dressed in civilian clothing at the time of the incident. Five other US service members joined in the incident after seeing the violent encounter, officials said.

Those detained were members of the Turkey Youth Union (TGB), a youth offshoot of the nationalist opposition Vatan Party. Police intervened in the incident and authorities are conducting an investigation, officials said.

“We can confirm reports that US service members embarked aboard the USS Wasp were the victims of an assault in İzmir today, and are now safe,” the US embassy to Turkey said on X. “We thank Turkish authorities for their rapid response and ongoing investigation.”

An apparent TGB social media account posted a video on X that purported to show a group of men holding a US soldier and placing a white hood over his head.

“No one will be able to respond to the cries for help from U.S. soldiers. Your hands are stained with the blood of our brave soldiers and thousands of Palestinians,” @YouthUnionTR said in its X missive.

TGB posted a video on X in November 2021 where members boasted about putting a sack on a US soldier. “YANKEE GO HOME!” TGB said in a caption on the post.

The US embassy in Ankara said earlier Monday that the Wasp was on a port visit to Izmir, a coastal town. The ship arrived on Sunday following joint training with Turkish military ships in the Mediterranean.

The US has ramped up its military presence in the Middle East as the Israel-Gaza war continues. An aircraft carrier, the Abraham Lincoln, and its strike group are presently operating in the region’s waters of US Central Command, according to Navy Times."
Man accused of enlisting strangers to rape drugged wife goes on trial in France,Kim Willsher,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"A husband who allegedly drugged his wife and invited more than 80 strangers to rape her at their home for almost a decade went on trial on Monday in a case that has shocked France.

Fifty men accused of taking part in the abuse of the woman are also on trial at the court in Avignon. More than a dozen feminists dressed in black protested outside the courthouse as the trial opened.

Police say Dominique Pélicot crushed sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication and mixed it into his wife Gisèle’s evening meal or in her wine at their home in Mazan, near Carpentras in Provence. The father of three recruited men to rape and sexually abuse her from an online chatroom, where members fantasised about performing sexual acts on non-consenting partners.

The presiding judge, Roger Arata, announced that all hearings would be public, granting Gisèle Pélicot her wish for “complete publicity until the end” of the court case, according to one of her lawyers, Stéphane Babonneau.

The trial would nonetheless be “a horrible ordeal” for her, said another of her lawyers, Antoine Camus.

“For the first time, she will have to live through the rapes that she endured over 10 years,” he told Agence France-Presse, adding that his client had “no recollection” of the abuse that she discovered only in 2020.

Gisèle Pélicot, who arrived at the court supported by her three children, did not want a trial behind closed doors because “that’s what her attackers would have wanted”, Camus said.

The accused men recruited by her husband were instructed to avoid smelling of any kind of fragrance or cigarette smoke to avoid alerting his wife and to leave if she moved so much as an arm, investigators said.

Dominique Pélicot was arrested on 2 November 2020, after a security guard caught him filming up the skirts of women in the local supermarket. Police found a file labelled “abuses” on a USB drive connected to his computer that contained 20,000 images and films of his wife being raped almost 100 times.

Since his arrest he “always declared himself guilty”, his lawyer has said, adding that he had said: “I put her to sleep, I offered her, and I filmed.”

Health records reportedly show he obtained 450 sleeping pills in one year alone.

The 50 men on trial with him include a local councillor, nurses, a journalist, a former police officer, a prison guard, soldier, firefighter and civil servant, many of whom lived around Mazan, a town of about 6,000 inhabitants. The men were aged between 26 and 73 at the time of their arrests.

Several of the accused have denied the charges, telling police they had no idea Gisèle Pélicot, who married Dominique Pélicot in 1973, was not a willing partner and accused him of tricking them. Detectives were unable to identify and trace more than 30 other men who were recorded.

Investigators said she was devastated to learn of the abuse, saying she had no recollection whatsoever of being raped. She had been drugged “almost to a state of coma”, investigators added.

“One morning she woke in a panic with a new haircut without understanding how this was possible. She went to her hairdresser, who told her she had been in the previous day,” Babonneau said.

He said his client, now divorced, had believed she had an illness nobody could explain and consulted several doctors, always accompanied by her husband, who blamed her symptoms on tiredness after looking after their grandchildren. Her three children and other relatives suspected she had Alzheimer’s disease.

The public prosecutor and lawyers for the defendants had asked for the trial to take place behind closed doors for reasons of “decency” and to protect all parties.

“The trial involves acts of extreme violence repeated over a period of ten years of so. Photographs will be circulated, videos will necessarily be viewed and it appears that publicity would be dangerous for public decency and would undermine the dignity of the individuals, both victims and defendants,” the prosecutor argued.

But Gisèle Pélicot’s lawyers objected. “She wants people to know what happened to her and believes that she has no reason to hide. No one can imagine that my client will find any satisfaction in exposing what she has suffered. She wants this hearing to be open so that justice can be done in public,” Babonneau said.

“Whether one likes it or not, this trial goes beyond the limits of this courtroom. And going behind closed doors also means asking my client to be locked in a place with those who attacked her.”

After deliberating, the five professional judges hearing the case ruled it should be held in public.

Dominique Pélicot is also accused of the rape and murder of a 23-year-old estate agent in Paris in 1991. Sophie Narme was drugged, raped and stabbed in the chest.

Another estate agent, 19, was attacked in similar circumstances but escaped after fighting back. Police have said DNA extracted from blood at the scene matched his profile.

The trial in Avignon is expected to last four months. Dominique Pélicot, 71, and the 50 other defendants face 20 years in prison if convicted of aggravated rape."
Anti-immigration leftists have potential to upend German political scene,Kate Connolly,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"It was, Sahra Wagenknecht declared on the social media platform X on Sunday, “a historic result” achieved from almost a standing start. Within eight months, her leftwing-conservative Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) has gone from an upstart party of breakaway populists to a decisive player with the potential to upend the German political scene.

The BSW party’s third place position in state elections in the eastern states of Thuringia (16%) and Saxony (12%), behind the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), now puts it in the position of kingmaker.

Like the other established mainstream parties, the BSW has scotched any possibility of entering into a formal coalition with the AfD, though it has not ruled out cooperation on subjects on which the parties are aligned. But its strong standing means negotiations in neither state can take place without it.

Asked on Sunday night whether she was ready to negotiate for a position in the states’ governments, Wagenknecht, 55, responded with an enigmatic smile. By Monday, she appeared triumphant, emboldened – and more open to the idea.

“This is a magnificent day,” she said at a press conference flanked by the party’s lead candidates from both states. “We have become a power factor in Germany … We can use that position to really move things in this country.” The vote for the BSW, she added, was “an expression of the mood in Germany”.

Wagenknecht’s views are an eclectic mixture of left-leaning economics, anti-immigration rhetoric and a foreign policy grounded in suspicion of the US and residual support for Russia.

For years the face of Die Linke (The Left), the group born out of the former East German Communist party, Wagenknecht had often expressed frustration with conventional politics. In 2018 she launched Aufstehen (Get Up), a movement inspired by the gilets jaunes protests in France and the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Momentum in the UK. And last autumn, after months of flirting with the idea, she quit Die Linke for good to form her eponymous party.

Under her leadership, and amid widespread dissatisfaction with the coalition government of Olaf Scholz, the BSW has stormed the political charts, quickly overtaking Die Linke, and efficiently using June’s European parliamentary elections as a springboard to more prominence and popularity.

It has been described as filling a gap in the political landscape, by combining both leftwing and rightwing policies – campaigning on everything from more generous pensions and an increase in the minimum wage to constraining climate protection measures and toughening asylum regulations.

Like the AfD, which rose to prominence on the coattails of disgruntlement over the former chancellor Angela Merkel’s “open door” policy for refugees in 2015, Wagenknecht has benefited from the growing perception that Europe’s largest economy is overburdened by refugees.

Born in Jena, in the state of Thuringia, Wagenknecht has been married for the past decade to 80-year-old Oskar Lafontaine, the former Social Democrats’ (SPD) finance minister under Gerhard Schröder, before he too defected to Die Linke in protest over the SPD’s labour reforms.

That divisive move is seen as a reminder of the havoc Wagenknecht could yet wreak on the CDU if its leader, Friedrich Merz, moves towards a hitherto unlikely and ideologically fraught alliance with the BSW. The party’s general secretary, Carsten Linnemann, has done nothing to win her over, describing her as “left, and/or right-wing extremist”, and “communist”. His stance was dismissed as “absurd” by BSW’s chairwoman, Amira Mohamed Ali, who said it might well impede a collaboration.

Monday’s press conference brought a flavour of the BSW’s positioning. The party’s successful candidates, Sabine Zimmermann for Saxony and Katja Wolf for Thuringia, spoke of the need to improve daily life, such as public transport, digitalisation in the health system, and standards in the classroom.

For her part, Wagenknecht was keener to emphasise her goals beyond state level: tackling the government’s “ruinous” energy policy, halting the decision to station medium-range US missiles on German soil and criticising the notion that sending weapons to Ukraine– “which plays into people’s rage when school buildings are so dilapidated” – can end the Russian invasion.

Wagenknecht walks a fine line geopolitically, not advocating for Germany’s exit from the EU or Nato (unlike the AfD), but calling emphatically for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia for an end to the war. “Diplomatic means had “by no means” been exhausted, she said on Monday

A few years ago, Wagenknecht withdrew from the public arena, citing burnout, but now she has come back with a vengeance. The politician who was attacked with paint at an election rally in Erfurt last week, is now almost certain to be a leading – and deeply polarising – player in next year’s federal election, scheduled for September 2025."
"Israel-Gaza war live: IDF raids will see Israeli hostages return ‘in coffins’, Hamas armed wing says",Yohannes Lowe,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"07.23 BST IDF raids will see Israeli hostages return ‘in coffins’, Hamas armed wing says

Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Israel’s war in Gaza and the wider crisis in the Middle East.

Hamas’s armed wing, al-Qassam Brigades, has said hostages would return to Israel “inside coffins” if military pressure continued, warning that new instructions were issued in June to militants guarding the captives on what to do if Israeli troops approached.

Spokesperson Abu Obeida said in a statement: “[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu’s insistence on liberating the prisoners through military pressure instead of concluding a deal will mean that they will return to their families inside coffins.”

The announcement comes days after Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) recovered the bodies of six hostages from a tunnel in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. According to Israel’s health ministry, they had been shot at close range about two days before their remains were discovered.

The new instructions, Obeida said, were given to guards of hostages after a rescue operation by Israel in June. At that time, Israeli forces freed four hostages in a raid in which scores of Palestinians, including women and children, were killed.

In a press conference on Monday, the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: “Israel will not accept the massacre of six hostages, Hamas will pay a heavy price.”

Below is a summary of some of the latest developments:

The US president, Joe Biden , said that a “final” deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza was “very close” but that he did not think the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu , was doing enough to secure such an agreement. Netanyahu, in a press conference, said he did not believe that Biden made those comments.

Netanyahu insisted that Israeli forces must retain control over the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border, which has emerged as a primary sticking point in Gaza ceasefire talks. He described it as “Hamas’s oxygen pipe”.

The UK moved to immediately suspend 30 arms export licences to Israel after a review by the government found a “clear risk” that UK arms may be used in serious violation of humanitarian law relating to the treatment of Palestinian detainees and the supply of aid to Gaza.

Protests against the Israeli leader’s government suffered a blow yesterday when a court ordered an early end to a general strike. Israel’s biggest trade union, Histadrut , said hundreds of thousands of people joined its strike. Israel’s labour court ruled that the strike, which affected many businesses, schools and transport routes, had to end at 14:30 local time (12:30 BST). It was due to finish at 18:00 local time (16:00 BST).

The demonstrations were prompted by the discovery of the bodies of six hostages in Gaza, and brought tens of thousands of Israelis out on to the streets to protest against the government’s handling of the war in Gaza and efforts to release dozens of hostages who remain in captivity.

Ben Gurion international airport near Tel Aviv saw some flights delayed, and none at all for two hours leading up to 10am. Tel Aviv and the northern coastal city of Haifa heeded the strike calls, but not all municipalities slowed down or ceased their activities.

Further protests took place outside Netanyahu’s residences in Jerusalem and Caesarea.

At least 40,786 Palestinian people have been killed and 94,224 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Monday.

UN agencies and other organisations will administer polio vaccines to children under the age of 10 in central Gaza today, as the vaccination campaign continues for its third day. The health ministry said about 160,000 children received the first dose of the polio vaccine in the central governorate in the Gaza Strip on Sunday and Monday."
‘We cannot protect our children’: parents in Gaza face new threat of polio,Malak A Tantesh,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Like so many in Gaza, Eid al-Attar, a teacher from the north of the territory, now spends his days trying to find enough food and water to keep his family alive. Displaced eight times since the war between Israel and Hamas broke out in October, the 42-year-old has tried his best to shield his five children from the conflict. Now the Palestinian territory is facing a new danger: the highly infectious and potentially deadly disease, polio.

“We cannot protect our children. We are exposed to death at any moment due to the constant bombardment and insecurity. And I cannot protect them from diseases either,” he said in Deir al-Balah on Sunday as a UN-led vaccination campaign got under way.

“We live in a tent, which does not protect us from anything, there are no medicines, there is garbage everywhere, and the streets are filled with wastewater.”

Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza has decimated the territory’s healthcare system, with 31 of 36 hospitals damaged or destroyed, according to the World Health Organization. About 90% of the 2.3 million people who live in the Gaza Strip have been displaced from their homes, with the majority living in very overcrowded, unsanitary makeshift camps. Hepatitis, pneumonia and diarrheal diseases such as dysentery, as well as scabies, lice and debilitating rashes are already rife, the WHO said.

The number of deaths caused by illness of more than 40,000 casualties recorded by the health ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory is unclear. But one of healthcare workers’ worst fears were confirmed last week when Gaza recorded its first case of type 2 polio in a quarter century. The contagious disease can cause paralysis and death, particularly in infants and young children.

Polio was eradicated from the Gaza Strip in 1999, but a strain was detected in routine wastewater testing in July. It is believed to have come from an oral polio vaccine, which contains a weakened live virus, and can in rare cases be shed by vaccinated people and evolve into a new, contagious form.

The first case was reported last week in a 10-month-old boy, who is paralysed in one leg. He did not receive any routine childhood vaccinations because of the war. According to the WHO, hundreds more people are probably already infected, but not showing symptoms, putting hundreds of thousands of children in Gaza at risk.

An incredibly complex vaccination drive led by the UN and local health authorities is now under way to prevent the re-emergence of polio among a new generation.

At least 90% of Gaza’s 640,000 children under 10 must be vaccinated with two drops of oral vaccine in two rounds, four weeks apart, to prevent the disease from spreading – a formidable goal in an active war zone where conditions can change rapidly.

Hamas and Israel have agreed to humanitarian pauses in fighting between 6am and 3pm for the next few days during which vaccination teams aim to visit 160 sites, beginning in central Gaza before travelling to harder-to-reach areas. Damaged or destroyed roads make it difficult for healthcare workers to move around, and aid workers and shipments have been hit by Israeli bombings.

Four people were killed in an Israeli airstrike last week that hit the front of a convoy carrying food and fuel to a hospital in Rafah, the American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera) group said. Israel said it had targeted gunmen who seized the convoy, although Anera and witnesses denied that any armed fighters were in the area.

Israel allowed about 1.3m doses to be brought into Gaza last month, which are now being held in refrigerated storage in a warehouse in the central town of Deir al-Balah. Another shipment of 400,000 doses is expected to arrive in the territory soon.

“Israel views with importance the prevention of a polio outbreak in the Gaza Strip, including for the purpose of preventing the spread of diseases in the region”, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement last week.

Fuel shortages make powering the generators that keep the vaccinations cool another major struggle, since existing cold chain storage facilities have all been destroyed. Dr Khalil Abu Qasmiya, the director of the health ministry in Deir al-Balah, said he and his team are waking up at regular intervals in the night to check that the fridge temperatures are stable and ice packs have not melted. “Since the first case of polio appeared, the ministry of health has bent over backwards to do our part,” he said.

Unlike many other international efforts to alleviate the suffering in Gaza, the polio vaccine rollout is so far going smoothly: 72,600 children were vaccinated on the operation’s first day, the Gaza health ministry said. It is also hoped that the efforts made to repair the cold chain system would allow routine immunisations to begin once the polio campaign was completed.

Nabil al-Hasanat, 50, a father of two girls, aged six and five months, said: “We are all suffering a lot. I am glad I can do one thing to protect my children.”

The underlying humanitarian crisis remains, however, with no sign of a breakthrough in ceasefire talks soon.

Jose Lainez Kafati, a social and behaviour change specialist at Unicef Palestine, said: “Polio is just one of the many problems the children of Gaza are facing.

“While we have managed to start the polio vaccination, there are other serious problems that are still unattended by the lack of access to aid. The total breakdown of the healthcare system, the almost complete destruction of sanitation and water infrastructure, as well as the living conditions of families who no longer have a home, makes them vulnerable to other disease outbreaks.”"
Defiant Netanyahu insists Israel must control strategic border corridor in Gaza,Julian Borger,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"Benjamin Netanyahu has defied protests at home and criticism from Joe Biden by vowing that Israel would not relinquish control over a strategic corridor along the Gaza-Egyptian border.

In a combative press conference, the Israeli prime minister presented control of the Philadelphi corridor along Gaza’s border with Egypt as a primary war aim, entrenching a position that has emerged as a key obstacle to a ceasefire deal.

“Israel will not accept the massacre of six hostages, Hamas will pay a heavy price,” said Netanyahu, standing in front of a wall-sized map of the Gaza Strip that included clip art of bombs and missiles crossing the border. “Iran’s axis of evil needs the Philadelphi corridors … Israel must control it.”

The remarks came hours after the US president met with his top advisers on the Gaza conflict and told reporters that he did not believe Netanyahu was doing enough to secure a ceasefire deal with Hamas.

Netanyahu’s remarks came after protests this weekend and a general strike on Monday prompted by the discovery of the bodies of six hostages in Gaza. Tens of thousands of Israelis demonstrated against the government’s handling of the war in Gaza and efforts to release dozens of hostages who remain in captivity.

Hamas’s armed wing said on Monday that hostages would return to Israel “inside coffins” if military pressure continued, warning that “new instructions” had been given to the militants guarding the captives if Israeli troops approached.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Biden said that his administration was “very close” to proposing a “final” hostage deal to both sides that has assumed new urgency since the discovery of the bodies, including that of Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin.

The Washington Post had previously reported that the Biden administration was preparing to propose a “take it or leave it” deal that, if it failed, could mark the end of US-led efforts to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

Biden did not reveal details of the new proposal and, asked why he thought a new deal could prove successful after months of unsuccessful attempts, said: “Hope springs eternal.”

The White House said that Biden received a briefing from top-level advisers including the national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, where they discussed “next steps” in the ceasefire efforts in collaboration with co-mediators Egypt and Qatar.

Netanyahu has remained defiant over Israeli claims to strategic points in Gaza, despite significant internal and international pressure to secure at least a temporary ceasefire in the 11-month-old war.

During his remarks on Monday, the Israeli prime minister apologised to the families of the six hostages found dead in Gaza over the weekend, but then quickly pivoted to defend his government’s control over the Philadelphi corridor. That has been seen as a non-starter for a potential ceasefire deal with Hamas.

“In the war against the axis of evil, in this specific war against Hamas and also in the north, we have set four goals: defeat Hamas; return our hostages; ensure that Gaza does not pose a threat; and to return residents to the south,” he said. “Three of these goals pass through the Philadelphi route, Hamas’s oxygen pipe.”

The Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid, derided Netanyahu’s presentation as “political spin” with “no relation to reality”.

“Not one professional buys this spin. Not the security personnel, not the international system, not the fighters who are actually in Gaza and know the reality there,” Lapid said, according to the Times of Israel.

The Philadelphi corridor has only emerged as an Israeli government talking point in recent weeks, and was not part of the plan that Biden presented in May, which the Israeli government said at the time it accepted.

The Hostage Families Forum vowed that their protests would continue, but the far-right members of Netanyahu’s government coalition declared victory after a labour court ruling that the strike had to end at 2.30pm local time (12.30pm BST).

Even before the court ruling, the strike, called by the Histadrut trade union federation, was not seen as a significant threat to the government. It had only been due to last a day, and only a few local authorities took part.

Banks and many private businesses closed or gave their employees the option of taking the day off, but it was not the prolonged stoppage that activists hoped would have an impact on the economy and force the coalition into a ceasefire-for-hostage deal with Hamas.

Public anger erupted after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) found the hostages’ bodies in a tunnel deep under the Palestinian city of Rafah over the weekend. According to Israel’s health ministry, they had been shot at close range about two days before their remains were discovered. Some of them – including Goldberg-Polin – would have been in the first batch of hostages to be released under the proposed ceasefire deal.

Goldberg-Polin’s funeral was held in Jerusalem on Monday. Addressing the family at the ceremony, Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, apologised for his death on behalf of the state.

“We are sorry we failed to protect you in the terrible failure of 7 October,” Herzog said. “We are sorry we failed to bring you home safely. We are sorry that the country you immigrated to at the age of seven, wrapped in the Israeli flag, failed to keep you.”

About 250 hostages were seized by Hamas in its 7 October surprise attack on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians. In the Gaza war that followed, Israel forces have killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, the large majority of them civilians.

Other countries have slightly increased pressure on Israel since the botched rescue of the hostages. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, on Monday announced the suspension of 30 of 350 arms export licenses to Israel. Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said he was “deeply disheartened” by the decision at a time when “we fight a war on seven different fronts”.

The extreme right members of Netanyahu’s coalition welcomed the decision of the Bat Yam labour court to order Monday’s strike to end early. The finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said the strike had been “political and illegal”, serving the interests of Hamas.

The Hostage Families Forum said that protests would still continue after the strike, in the interests of the 101 hostages still unaccounted for in Gaza, of whom Israeli intelligence believes about a third are already dead.

The forum said the surviving hostages had been “abandoned” on Thursday last week, when Netanyahu’s cabinet voted to stand behind the prime minister’s negotiating position insisting on Israeli control of the Philadelphi corridor. Gallant was the only cabinet member to vote against the stance, and has called for the decision to be reversed.

About 100,000 protesters took part in demonstrations in Tel Aviv on Sunday night, temporarily blocking the north-south motorway that runs through the city. On Monday, there were sporadic protests blocking key road junctions around the country and another big demonstration was called for Monday night.

Among even the most determined demonstrators however was an acceptance that they did not yet have the strength to threaten Netanyahu’s hold on power and force him to change course.

“I’m not sure the strike was as powerful as people expected,” said Debbie Mason, a social worker for the Eshkol regional council, an area of southern Israel abutting Gaza, where many of the victims of the 7 October Hamas attack lived.

“Unfortunately, there are too many things that are going to obstruct a deal. Whether it’s on our side, whether it’s on Hamas’s side, it just doesn’t seem to be in anyone’s interest that something should happen,” Mason said.

She was speaking in “Hostages Square”, a plaza between the national library and the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, where hostage families and their supporters gather every day.

Rayah Karmin, a vitamin supplement salesperson from Mabu’im, a village near Netivot near the Gaza frontier, agreed that a one-day strike would change little.

“Only a longer strike will make the people in government understand that the economy of Israel is going to go down,” Karmin said.

She pointed out that all the protests faced an immovable political reality: that if a ceasefire were agreed, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich would lead a far-right walk-out from the cabinet and the coalition would fall, removing Netanyahu’s immunity against corruption charges he faces in Israeli courts.

“Smotrich and Ben-Gvir will leave Netanyahu, and then he will be without a coalition, and he will have to go home,” Karmin said. “And he knows that next time he won’t be elected, so he wants to stay as long as he can.”"

Lammy, the foreign secretary, said that his decision told should not be seen as the UK determining whether Israel has or has not committed war crimes. He said: Throughout my life, I have been a friend of Israel. A liberal, progressive Zionist who believes in Israel as a democratic state and a homeland for the Jewish people, which has both the right to exist and defend itself. But I believe also that Israel will only exist in safety and security if there is a two-state solution that guarantees the rights of all Israeli citizens and their Palestinian neighbours, who have their own inalienable right to self determination and security. As concern that the horrifying scenes in Gaza has risen, many in this House, as well as esteemed lawyers and international organisations have raised British arms export licensing to Israel.

We have rigorously followed every stage of the process which the previous Conservative government established, and let me first be clear on the review’s scope, this government is not an international court. We have not and could not arbitrate on whether or not Israel has breached international humanitarian law. This is a forward looking evaluation, not a determination of innocence or guilt, and it does not prejudge any future determinations by the competent courts. He explained why the government was suspending about 30 arms export licences to Israel. He said: Facing a conflict such as this, it is this government’s legal duty to review export licences. Criteria 2C of the strategic export licensing criteria states that the Government will not issue export licences if there is a clear risk that the items might be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law. It is with regret that I inform the house today the assessment I have received leaves me unable to conclude anything other than that for certain UK arms exports to Israel, there does exist a clear risk that they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law. I have informed [Jonathan Reynolds] the business and trade secretary from a total of approximately 350 to Israel, as required under the export controls act. These include equipment that we assess is for use in the current conflict in Gaza. He said that Israel could be doing more to avoid civilian deaths in Israel, and that the UK government was “deeply concerned” about the allegations of detainees being mistreated by the Israelis. He said: Israel’s actions in Gaza continue to lead to immense loss of civilian life, widespread destruction to civilian infrastructure, and immense suffering. In many cases, it’s not impossible to reach determinative conclusion on allegations regarding Israel’s conduct of facilities, in part because there is insufficient information, either from Israel or other reliable sources to verify such claims. Nevertheless, it is the assessment of His Majesty’s Government that Israel could recently do more to ensure life-saving food and medical supplies reach civilians in Gaza, in light of the appalling humanitarian situation. And this government is also deeply concerned by credible claims of mistreatment of detainees, which the International Committee of the Red Cross cannot investigate after being denied access to places of detention. Both my predecessor and all our major allies have repeatedly and forcefully raised these concerns with the Israeli government. Regrettably, they have not been addressed satisfactorily. He said there was “no equivalence” between the Hamas terrorists and Israel’s democratic government. He said: There can be no doubt that Hamas pays not the slightest heed to international humanitarian law. It endangers civilians by embedding itself in a tightly concentrated civilian population and in civilian infrastructure. He said what he was announcing was “not a blanket ban” on arms sales to Israel and “not an arms embargo”. He said the government was not suspending licences for the F-35 fighter jet programe. Suspending those licences would underming the global F-35 supply chain “that is vital for the security of the UK, our allies and Nato”, he said. So F-35 licences are exempt from this decision. (This article by Patrick Wintour last week explains why banning F-35 licences would be so damaging to relations with the US.) He said that Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat ministers had all suspended arms sales to Israel in the past. “In 1982 Margaret Thatcher imposed a full arms embargo, and oil embargo, on Israel as they fought in Lebanon,” he said. He said Gordon Brown had suspended some licences in 2009, and Vince Cable has chosen not to issue new licences in 2014. Later, in response to a question, Lammy made the point that his restrictions on arms sales to Israel did not go as far as Thatcher’s. He said the UK government continued to support Israel’s right to self-defence in accordance with international law. He said the government was imposing new sanctions on four targets from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). He said: We’re announcing new sanctions on four IRGC force targets who have a role in supporting Iranian proxy actions in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, through the UK’s dedicated Iran sanctions regime. We’ve sanctioned over 400 Iranian individuals and entities and through our work with partners, we are exposing and containing Iran’s destabilising weapons development, where soon we’ll be introducing further regulations to bolster existing bans on the export of goods and technology significant to Iran’s production of drones and missiles. So let me be clear, we will continue to work with Israel and our partners to tackle the threat from Iran across the region. This government will continue to stand for Israel’s security, and we will always do in a manner which is consistent with our obligations to domestic and international law.

He said that, with regret, the government has concluded that these items could be used “in serious violation of international humanitarian law”. He said that around 30 arms exports licences are being suspended, out of around 350. He said these were items that could have been used in Gaza, such as components for aircraft. Share

15h ago 16.26 BST Cleverly says he is not calling for ECHR withdrawal, saying voters do not trust 'shorthand answers and quick fixes' During the Q&A after his speech this morning James Cleverly, the Tory leadership candidate, said that he was not calling for the UK to leave the European convention on human rights as a means of tackling irregular migration. Asked about the topic, he said: The simple fact is that if we try to grab shorthand answers and quick fixes, the British people will look at us and say ‘we’ve heard that before’. We need to be honest and open. We need to show where things are difficult and how they can be achieved. This is why those small number of voluntary asylum seekers went to Rwanda, because the supreme court’s argument was that Rwanda was inherently dangerous for asylum seekers. I was building an evidence base with asylum seekers in Rwanda to prove that was not the case. That is how we would have defeated the supreme court. That’s how we would have got the flights off the ground. Not by soundbites or quick fixes but by graft, but by delivery and focus. This is what we have to do to regain credibility and get back into government. This is similar to the line adopted by Kemi Badenoch (see 11.36am) this morning (although it was more surprising coming from Badenoch, who is generally more rightwing than Cleverly). Badenoch and Cleverly were not giving a commitment to remain in the ECHR in all circumstances; they were just declining to back withdrawal. Their two main rivals, Robert Jenrick and Tom Tugendhat, are backing withdrawal – with Jenrick enthusiastically in favour, and Tugendhat not ruling it out. Mel Stride has also refused to rule out leaving the ECHR. Priti Patel has said she is not backing withdrawal because it would be divisive and impractical. This is not necessarily what people would have expected before the contest started. Generally, Tory rightwingers have been in favour of ECHR withdrawal, and “centrists” or “leftwingers” (neither label is ideal) have been opposed. But we now have two rightwingers (Badenoch and Patel) backing away from the idea, and two on the other side (Tugendhat and Stride) leaning into it. This may be a sign of candidates identified with one wing of the party trying to reach out to the other side. And it may also be a sign of candidates not being sure what Tory members will regard as the “right” answer. According to a recent report by Gordon Rayner for the Telegraph, a private poll of Tory members carried out by one of the campaigns found that 33% of members were in favour of withdrawal, 22% in favour of remaining, and 29% in favour of reforming the terms of membership.

16h ago 15.40 BST At her Tory leadership campaign launch this morning Kemi Badenoch, the shadow housing secretary, rejected claims that she was obsessed with culture war issues. (See 11.37am.) But during housing questions in the Commons this afternoon, she devoted her first two questions to “Islamist sectarianism”. She started by asking if Angela Rayner, the housing secretary and deputy PM, had read Sara Khan’s review into social cohesion. When Rayner gave a slighly evasive answer, Badenoch used her follow up to say the report covered the Batley Grammar School controversy, which led to a teacher going into hiding after Muslim parents objected to satirical cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad being shown to pupils. Badenoch said this episode demonstrated the problem posed by “Islamist sectraianism in communities like West Yorkshire”. In response, Rayner accused the last government of “stoking division” and said she hoped the Tories would now support Labour’s efforts to bring communities together. Badenoch used a subsequent question to ask Rayner if she would rule out increasing council tax. Rayner replied with a single word: “Yes.” As Lorin Bell-Cross reports for the Jewish Chronicle, at her campaign event this morning Badenoch said she was ""far more worried about the five new MPs elected on the back of sectarian Islamist politics” than about the five MPs elected for Reform UK. She claimed they represented “alien ideas that have no place here”. Share

16h ago 15.12 BST Kemi Badenoch’s Tory leadership campaign event made a good impression on some of the journalists and commentators who were watching. Here are some of their responses on social media. From Pippa Crerar, the Guardian’s political editor Strong campaign launch fr Kemi Badenoch that will appeal to Tory members with focus on renewing party but tacking right with complaint that previous govt “talked right but governed left”. But her forceful approach still makes many Tory MPs nervous. From Robert Shrimsley, the Financial Times’s chief political commentator Thought Kemi Badenoch absolutely nailed it. A clear appeal to her party, forceful, charismatic, forward looking, but also prepared not to offer cheap initiatives (arbitrary immigration caps, leaving ECHR). (PS for avoidance of doubt - that’s an appraisal not an endorsement!) From Lewis Goodall from the News Agents podcast A quietly impressive launch form Badenoch. She’s clearly thoughtful about her politics and has a clear sighted view of conservative principles. That said, there’s some fuzzy thinking (still talking about Blair inheritance as explanation as to why Conservative govt failed). Moreover danger for her is she overestimates salience of conservative battles to wider public. That ultimately she could be her own worst enemy. Here is Peter Walker’s story about the Badenoch launch.

17h ago 14.07 BST Voters don't know who most of Tory leadership candidates even are, poll suggests Tory supporters marginally favour James Cleverly as the next Conservative party leader, but mostly they don’t see any of the six candidates as obviously qualified to be the best replacement for Rishi Sunak, according to research published today. The findings are in a report from More in Common, which uses polling and findings from focus groups with former Tory voters and current party members to explore who might do best in the leadership contest. Amongst the public at large, 70% of people replied ‘don’t know’ (36%) or ‘none of them’ (34%) when asked which of the six candidates would make the Tories most likely to win the next election. Cleverly was on 8%, making him the best-performing of the six candidates. People who voted Conservative at the last election are more inclined to express a view (with Cleverly again coming top), but even with this cohort, almost half of respondents were not inspired by any candidate.

Israeli court orders end of nationwide strike called over handling of hostage talks,Unknown,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"Israel’s first nationwide general strike since the Hamas attacks of 7 October, which was convened in support of a deal to free hostages held in Gaza, has ended after eight hours with a court order for workers to go back to their jobs.

The strike was organised amid widespread public anger at the government’s handling of the war in Gaza after the discovery of the bodies of six hostages at the weekend.

It was called by Israel’s largest trade union, Histadrut, from 6am on Monday, closing government and municipal offices as well as schools and many private businesses. Israel’s international airport, Ben Gurion, was reported to have shut down at 8am local time (6am BST) for two hours.

The Tel Aviv labour court ordered an end to the strike on Monday, ruling that it was politically motivated and had not been called for economic reasons.

The chair of Histadrut, Arnon Bar-David, said in a statement before the strike: “I have come to the conclusion that only our intervention can shake those who need to be shaken.

“A deal is not progressing due to political considerations and this is unacceptable.”

The Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich – a far-right leader who opposes a truce in the war – was among those who had called on the court to move to ban the strike.

The strike action took place after tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets on Sunday night, cutting off the Ayalon highway, the motorway running through the heart of Tel Aviv, and lighting fires in the streets. A few dozen police officers tried to contain the protest but were unable to push it back. Local media reported that 29 people had been arrested.

The union called the strike after the Hostages and Missing Families Forum campaign group backed the idea in order to force the government to reach a deal for the return of the remaining hostages taken during Hamas’s attacks on 7 October. Israel’s opposition leader Yair Lapid also supported the move.

“Were it not for the delays, sabotage and excuses” in months of mediation efforts, the six hostages “would likely still be alive”, a statement from the group said, referring to the discovery of Carmel Gat, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Ori Danino in tunnels “dozens of metres” underground during fighting in Rafah, southern Gaza.

The Histadrut union has not taken such drastic action since March 2023, over Netanyahu’s controversial judicial overhaul plans.

The military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said all six hostages “were abducted alive on the morning of 7 October” and “brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them”.

However, the discoveries pointing to Hamas executions did little to deflect widespread fury towards Benjamin Netanyahu and his rightwing coalition for failing to agree a US-backed hostages-for-peace deal with Hamas, which has been on the negotiating table since late May. The longtime Israeli leader has been repeatedly accused of stalling on a ceasefire deal for his own political gain.

On Sunday, Netanyahu asked the hostage Lobanov’s parents for “forgiveness for not succeeding in bringing Sasha back alive”.

Some analysts said the public outcry over the six hostages who died could signal a new level of political pressure on Netanyahu. “I think this is an earthquake. This isn’t just one more step in the war,” said Nomi Bar-Yaacov, associate fellow in the International Security Programme at Chatham House, shortly before Sunday’s protests.

The US president, Joe Biden, said he was “devastated and outraged” by the hostage deaths, but told reporters he was “still optimistic” a deal could be reached.

Protests in Israel and strike called amid eruption of outrage over Gaza war,Julian Borger,2024-09-01 00:00:00,"Tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets on Sunday night and a general strike was called amid an eruption of public outrage over the government’s handling of the war in Gaza after the deaths of six hostages being held deep underground by Hamas.

The discovery of the hostages’ bodies in Gaza over the weekend threatened to bring deep divisions over the war to breaking point. An estimated 100,000 protested in Tel Aviv, while others demonstrated in Jerusalem as pressure on the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to reach a ceasefire deal to bring the remaining hostages home reached a new peak.

The first general strike since March last year is expected to bring large parts of Israel’s economy to a halt on Monday. Government and municipal offices were due to close, as well as schools and many private businesses. Israel’s international airport, Ben Gurion, is due to shut down at 8am local time (0600 BST) for an unknown period.

On Sunday night, demonstrators cut off the Ayalon highway, the motorway running through the heart of Tel Aviv. They filled the road and lit a bonfire in the middle lane near Hashalom, drumming and singing. A few dozen police officers tried to contain the protest but were unable to push it back.

“Officer, officer, who are you protecting?” the crowd chanted, and then: “Bibi [Netanyahu], you’re killing the hostages.”

On Sunday, Israel’s far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote to attorney general Gali Baharav-Miara asking her to seek an injunction against the strike, arguing that it would harm the economy and had no legal basis as its main aim was to influence government policy on state security.

“These issues are … not the subject of a strike by labour organisations and there is no connection between them and labour relations in Israel,” he wrote in his letter to Baharav-Miara.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the bodies of Carmel Gat, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Ori Danino were found in tunnels “dozens of metres” underground during fighting in Rafah in southern Gaza. The six were seized during Hamas’s 7 October attacks on Israel.

Israel’s health ministry said a forensic examination of the bodies showed the hostages had been “murdered by Hamas terrorists in a number of shots at close range” 48 to 72 hours before they were found.

However, the findings pointing to Hamas executions did little to deflect widespread fury towards Netanyahu and his rightwing coalition for failing to agree a US-backed hostages-for-peace deal with Hamas, which has been on the negotiating table since late May.

In a statement mourning the six hostages, the prime minister blamed Hamas for refusing to accept the deal.

“Whoever murders abductees does not want a deal,” Netanyahu said. “We, for our part, did not let up. The Israeli government is committed, and I am personally committed, to continue striving for a deal that will return all our abductees and guarantee our security and existence.”

Netanyahu: 'Whoever murders hostages does not want a deal' – video

Netanyahu’s claims were undermined by anonymous briefings to the press by security officials on Sunday, blaming his insistence on retaining strategic territory inside Gaza, particularly a strip along the Egyptian border called the Philadelphi corridor, for the failure to reach a breakthrough in the hostage negotiations.

The defence minister, Yoav Gallant, was the only government member to vote against Netanyahu’s stance on the corridor last week and he called on Sunday for the cabinet to reverse its position.

“It is too late for the hostages who were murdered in cold blood,” Gallant said, adding: “We must bring back the hostages that are still being held by Hamas.”

A senior Hamas official, Izzat al-Rishq, blamed the hostages’ deaths on Israel and the US, pointing to Israel’s failure to agree to a ceasefire deal he said Hamas had accepted. Rishq did not make any claims about how the hostages had died and did not comment on IDF suggestions that they had been executed.

An unnamed Hamas official was quoted by Agence France-Presse as saying the hostages had been “killed by the [Israeli] occupation’s fire and bombing”, a claim denied by the IDF and contradicted by the Israeli health ministry’s findings.

Announcing the general strike, the leader of the Histadrut trade union federation, Arnon Bar-David, said: “It is impossible to stand by any more and look the other way as our children are murdered in the tunnels of Gaza.

“We are no longer one country. This must be stopped. The state of Israel must be returned to normal. We are getting body bags instead of a deal. I have come to the conclusion that only our intervention might move those who need to be moved.”

Israeli schools are expected to send pupils home in late morning on Monday, and a large number of Tel Aviv restaurants and other private enterprises said they would close in solidarity with the public sector and the hostages.

At Sunday night’s demonstration, many protesters were hoping that the country had reached a tipping point.

“Today I woke up and just felt something changed,” said Danielle Galber, a 30-year-old PhD student in neurobiology. “I was heartbroken and angry, and felt: it’s been enough. Our country is falling apart.”

But Galber and her friend, Aaron, thought Monday’s planned general strike would put more pressure on Netanyahu than mere protests. Their workplaces, and those of everyone they knew across the private and public sectors, would be shutting down, but they did not know for how long. “There’s a chance,” Aaron said. “It depends on the strike. That might just push him towards a hostage deal.”

The strike call was welcomed by the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, a group of relatives of the abductees who have led the protest movement and calls for a ceasefire deal.

“Starting tomorrow the country will tremble. We call on the public to prepare to bring the country to a standstill,” the forum said. “These six individuals were taken alive, endured the horrors of captivity, and were then coldly murdered … A deal for the return of the hostages has been on the table for over two months. Were it not for the delays, sabotage and excuses those whose deaths we learned about this morning would likely still be alive.”

The last time Histadrut called a general strike, in March last year, it was triggered by Netanyahu’s sacking of Gallant for his opposition to the prime minister’s plans to limit the power and independence of the supreme court. The strike paralysed much of the economy but ended after a few hours when Netanyahu announced he would put his judicial changes on hold and about two weeks later he reversed his decision to sack Gallant.

While tens of thousands gathered to protest in Tel Aviv on Sunday night, thousands more joined the families of hostages in Jerusalem to protest outside Netanyahu’s office during a cabinet meeting. The demonstrators then marched to Chords light railway bridge and tried to block one of the main entrances to the city until they were forcibly dispersed by police.

Sigi Cohen, whose 26-year-old son, Eliya, is among the hostages still in Gaza, said: “I’m fed up. I want my son at home. Enough already. Enough with this policy.

“Eliya, if you hear me, take care of yourself and be strong. You won’t be there for more longer.”

Funerals began for the hostages on Sunday, adding more fuel to the popular anger.

“You were abandoned on and on, daily, hour after hour, 331 days,” Nira Sarusi said at the funeral of her son, Almog, whose body was wrapped in an Israeli flag. “You and so many beautiful and pure souls. Enough. No more.”

Hamas killed 1,200 people in its surprise attack on Israel in October. In the war in Gaza that followed, 40,691 Palestinians have been killed, according to the latest estimate by the Palestinian health ministry.

Of the 250 Israeli hostages seized on 7 October, eight have been rescued and more than 100 were released in an earlier temporary ceasefire deal in November. The discovery of the six bodies leaves 101 hostages still unaccounted for in Gaza. The IDF has confirmed 35 of them are known to have died during the more than 10 months of captivity.

Dalia Cusnir’s two brothers-in-law, Eitan and Yair Horn, were abducted that day and are still in Gaza.

“We’re done talking,” Cusnir said. “Our family members who are being held hostage cannot wait any more, and the government is clearly not doing anything to promote a deal.”

Cusnir welcomed the general strike, but also called for millions of Israelis to come out in the streets to support a ceasefire, and for members of Netanyahu’s government who do not agree with his policies to stand up to him and threaten the viability of his coalition.

She was dismissive of the government’s claim that keeping hold of the Philadelphi corridor was a strategic necessity for Israel.

“All the security chiefs say that in the worst-case scenario, the army knows how to take it back,” Cusnir said. “They say it’s a strategic thing, but Judaism tells us that there’s only one strategic thing and that’s life. This is the only thing we cannot lose: ourselves, our values and our essence.”"
Afghan women sing in defiance of Taliban laws silencing their voices,Ashifa Kassam,2024-09-01 00:00:00,"Afghan women, both inside and outside the country, have posted videos of themselves singing in protest against the Taliban’s laws banning women’s voices in public.

Late last month the Taliban published new restrictions aimed, it said, at combating vice and promoting virtue. The 35-article document, which includes a raft of draconian laws, deems women’s voices to be potential instruments of vice and stipulates that women must not sing or read aloud in public, nor let their voices carry beyond the walls of their homes.

As rights campaigners reacted with horror, Afghan women began pushing back. Across the country, women began uploading videos of themselves singing, in defiance of the Taliban’s systematic efforts to erase women from the public sphere.

“No command, system or man can close the mouth of an Afghan woman,” one 23-year-old said after posting her own video.

The 39-second video showed her singing outdoors. The song she sang had been carefully chosen for its lyrics, which spoke of protest and strength. “I am not that weak willow that trembles in every wind,” she sang. “I am from Afghanistan.”

Women in Afghanistan are singing to protest the Taliban’s new “morality decree”. This decree is yet another brazen attack on human rights and must be immediately revoked. pic.twitter.com/ft6BeH7vdL — Amnesty International (@amnesty) August 29, 2024

In another video, reportedly recorded in Kabul, a woman is shown singing while dressed from head to toe in black. “You have silenced my voice for the foreseeable future,” she sang, her face concealed by a long veil. “You have imprisoned me in my home for the crime of being a woman.”

Other videos showed women in Afghanistan singing alone or in small groups, using hashtags such as “#My voice is not forbidden” and “#No to Taliban” as they raised their voices against what UN officials have described as a “gender-based apartheid”.

Others around the world soon joined in. “We do not go to the field with a gun, but our voice, our image,” said Hoda Khamosh, an Afghan woman living in Norway. She posted her own video in a bid to show “that we women are not just a few individuals who can be erased”, she said.

The new laws also force women to wear thick clothes that completely cover their bodies – including their faces – while in public, and bans them from looking directly at men they are not related to by blood or marriage.

Those who fail to comply with the restrictions can be detained and punished in a manner deemed appropriate by Taliban officials.

On Tuesday, the UN high commissioner for human rights called for the law to be repealed, describing it as “utterly intolerable”.

The new law cements policies that seek to completely erase women’s presence in public, “effectively attempting to render them into faceless, voiceless shadows”, said a spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani.

Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, they have steadily eroded women’s rights. Women and girls have been blocked from attending secondary school, banned from nearly all forms of paid employment, and barred from public parks and gyms.

Earlier this year, the Taliban also announced that they would resume the practice of stoning women to death for adultery."
‘Frightening’ Taliban law bans women from speaking in public,Annie Kelly,2024-08-26 00:00:00,"New Taliban laws that prohibit women from speaking or showing their faces outside their homes have been condemned by the UN and met with horror by human rights groups.

The Taliban published a host of new “vice and virtue” laws last week, approved by their supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, which state that women must completely veil their bodies – including their faces – in thick clothing at all times in public to avoid leading men into temptation and vice.

Women’s voices are also deemed to be potential instruments of vice and so will not be allowed to be heard in public under the new restrictions. Women must also not be heard singing or reading aloud, even from inside their houses.

“Whenever an adult woman leaves her home out of necessity, she is obliged to conceal her voice, face, and body,” the new laws state.

Men will also be required to cover their bodies from their navels to their knees when they are outside their homes.

From now on, Afghan women are also not allowed to look directly at men they are not related to by blood or marriage, and taxi drivers will be punished if they agree to drive a woman who is without a suitable male escort.

Women or girls who fail to comply can be detained and punished in a manner deemed appropriate by Taliban officials charged with upholding the new laws.

The restrictions have been condemned by Roza Otunbayeva, the special UN’s representative for Afghanistan, who has said they extend the “intolerable restrictions” on the rights of women and girls already imposed by the Taliban since they took power in August 2021.

“It is a distressing vision for Afghanistan’s future, where moral inspectors have discretionary powers to threaten and detain anyone based on broad and sometimes vague lists of infractions,” she said in a statement on Sunday. “It extends the already intolerable restrictions on the rights of Afghan women and girls, with even the sound of a female voice outside the home apparently deemed a moral violation.”

Speaking to Rukhshana Media, Mir Abdul Wahid Sadat, the president of the Afghan Lawyers Association, said that the new laws contradicted Afghanistan’s domestic and international legal obligations.

“From a legal standpoint this document faces serious issues,” he said. “It contradicts the fundamental principles of Islam [where] the promotion of virtue has never been defined through force, coercion, or tyranny.

“This document not only violates Afghanistan’s domestic laws but also broadly contravenes all 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.”

“The Taliban government does not have any sort of legitimacy and these new edicts designed to further erase and suppress woman are an indication of their hatred towards women,” says Fawzia Koofi, an Afghan human rights activist who was the first woman vice-president of the Afghan parliament.

“When they say women cannot speak in public as they regard women’s voices as a form of intimacy it is incredibly frightening yet the whole world acts like this is normal. There have been very few reactions of comments to what is happening and the Taliban are emboldened by this indifference. It is not only women but all human beings they are targeting. They must be held accountable.”

Shukria Barakzai, a former Afghan parliamentarian who was Afghanistan’s ambassador to Norway, agreed the international community’s silence on the Taliban’s oppression of Afghanistan’s 14 million women and girls had played its part in the criminalisation of women’s bodies and voices.

“It is concerning that international organisations, particularly the United Nations and the European Union, instead of standing against these inhumane practices, are trying to normalise relations with the Taliban,” she said. “They are, in a way, whitewashing this group, disregarding the fact that the Taliban are committing widespread human rights violations.”

In the three years since seizing power from the US-backed government, the Taliban have imposed what human rights groups are calling a “gender apartheid”, excluding women and girls from almost every aspect of public life and denying them access to the justice system.

Prior to the new “vice and virtue” laws, women and girls were already blocked from attending secondary school; banned from almost every form of paid employment; prevented from walking in public parks, attending gyms or beauty salons; and told to comply with a strict dress code.

Earlier this year, the Taliban also announced the reintroduction of the public flogging and stoning of women for adultery.

The Taliban have been approached for comment."
Bangladeshis taking refuge in emergency shelters after heavy flooding,Unknown,2024-08-24 00:00:00,"Nearly 300,000 Bangladeshis are taking refuge in emergency shelters from floods that inundated vast areas of the country, disaster officials said.

The floods were triggered by heavy monsoon rains and have killed at least 42 people in Bangladesh and India since the start of the week, many in landslides.

Lufton Nahar, 60, speaking from a relief shelter in Feni, one of the worst-hit districts near the border with India’s Tripura state, said: “My house is completely inundated. Water is flowing above our roof. My brother brought us here by boat. If he hadn’t, we would have died.”

The country of 170 million people is crisscrossed by hundreds of rivers and has experienced frequent floods in recent decades.

Monsoon rains cause widespread destruction every year but the climate crisis is shifting weather patterns and increasing the number of extreme weather events.

Highways and railway lines were damaged between the capital, Dhaka, and the main port city of Chattogram, making access to badly flooded districts difficult and disrupting businesses.

The flooding happened weeks after a student-led revolution toppled its government.

Among the worst-affected flood-hit areas is Cox’s Bazar, a district home to about 1 million Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar.

Sarat Kumar Das, a disaster agency official in the Indian state of Tripura, told Agence-France Presse that 24 people had been killed on the Indian side of the border since Monday.

Another 18 had been killed in Bangladesh, according to the disaster management ministry secretary, Md Kamrul Hasan, who said “285,000 people are living in emergency shelters” and adding that 4.5 million people in total had been affected.

When the floods hit, Bangladesh was recovering from weeks of civil unrest that culminated in the autocratic ex-leader Sheikh Hasina fleeing the country.

With an interim government led by the Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus still finding its feet, ordinary Bangladeshis have been crowdfunding relief efforts, organised by the same students who led the protests that led to the ousting of Hasina, who remains in India after fleeing Dhaka.

Crowds visited Dhaka University on Friday to offer cash donations as students loaded rice sacks and crates of bottled water on to vehicles for areas affected by the deluge.

Much of Bangladesh is made up of deltas where the great Himalayan rivers, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, wind towards the sea after coursing through India. Several tributaries of the two transnational rivers were still overflowing/ However, forecasts showed rain was likely to ease in the coming days."
Modi tells Zelenskiy he is ready to work ‘as a friend’ to bring about peace deal,Luke Harding,2024-08-23 00:00:00,"India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, made a historic visit to Kyiv on Friday and told Volodymyr Zelenskiy he was ready to work “as a friend” to bring about a peace deal that would end Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Modi said he respected and supported Ukraine’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity”. “It is our highest priority,” he said, adding that he had told Vladimir Putin during their meeting in July that “problems cannot be resolved on the battlefield”. The war could only end through “dialogue and diplomacy”, he stressed.

The trip is the first to Ukraine by an Indian leader since the country’s 1991 independence from the Soviet Union. It follows a period of strained relations. Zelenskiy criticised Modi’s recent trip to Moscow, which came on the same day Russian missiles flattened a children’s hospital in Kyiv.

Modi has sought to present his government as a neutral peace broker. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, prompting western sanctions, India has imported large volumes of discounted Russian oil. It attended Ukraine’s July peace summit in Switzerland but did not sign a communique.

But the Kremlin’s deepening partnership with China – India’s biggest geo-political and neighbourhood rival – has prompted a reassessment. On Friday, Zelenskiy embraced Modi warmly and described his support for Ukraine’s integrity in the face of Russian aggression as “critical”.

“Today, history was made,” Zelenskiy posted on X. He pointed out Modi’s “friendly” and “symbolic” visit came on the eve of celebrations for Ukraine’s independence day.

The two leaders stood together in front of a museum memorial to Ukrainian children killed by Russian missiles. In official talks, they discussed the 10-point peace formula Zelenskiy has presented to the international community, India’s foreign ministry said.

The blueprint envisages the withdrawal of Russian troops from occupied areas, reparations and war crime tribunals for Russian generals and political figures. Ukrainian officials are preparing to organise a second peace summit this year, and are keen to involve global south countries. One venue under discussion is Saudi Arabia, it is understood.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser in the Ukrainian president’s office, said Friday’s discussions in Kyiv were significant because Delhi “really has a certain influence” over Moscow.

“It’s extremely important for us to effectively build relations with such countries, to explain to them what the correct end to the war is – and that it is also in their interests,” he told Reuters.

Modi’s trip comes at a time when the Russian and Ukrainian armies are both making gains. Two and a half weeks ago Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Russia. On Friday, its military said it had used US-supplied glide bombs to carry out precision strikes on a Russian platoon base in the Kursk region, destroying enemy equipment. A video showed explosions and clouds of smoke.

Ukraine’s armed forces now control a 1,250 sq km salient inside Russia, centred on the town of Sudzha. The Kremlin has downplayed the incursion and pledged to drive out Ukrainian “terrorists”. About 130,000 Russians have fled. Fierce fighting continues in the town of Korenevo and in a dozen frontline villages.

The invasion of Russia – the first by foreign troops since the second world war – has gone better for Kyiv than expected. On Thursday, Zelenskiy said the “buffer zone” had reduced cross-border shelling of civilians. It is unclear if there is a Ukrainian military exit strategy if Putin responds with overwhelming force.

In the Donetsk region, however, Russian combat units backed by war planes have been pushing forward. They are now 11km from the city of Pokrovsk, a Ukrainian military hub, and 5km from the town of Myrnohrad. Ukraine had hoped the surprise attack on Kursk province might force Moscow to scale down its Pokrovsk assault.

But according to Ukrainian sources, there has been no meaningful withdrawal of Russian forces. Instead, units have been pulled out from virtually everywhere else, including Toretsk, a frontline city under intense Russian fire. Putin still believes he can achieve a breakthrough in the eastern front, the sources suggest.

Ukraine’s 3rd separate assault brigade, meanwhile, said it had advanced nearly 2km in the Kharkiv region. It did not give details. In May, Russian troops staged their own cross-border incursion in the area and seized the city of Vovchansk. Russian troops are hanging on in several districts. One battle group is reportedly encircled in a meat factory.

Over the past week Ukraine has used long-range drones to target numerous critical infrastructure sites inside Russia. They include an airfield which appears to have suffered extensive damage near the city of Volgograd after an attack on Thursday. An oil depot hit early this week in Rostov was still burning on Friday, with a huge fire.

On Friday, the US imposed sanctions on more than 400 entities and individuals for supporting Russia’s war effort in Ukraine, including Chinese firms that US officials believe are helping Moscow to skirt western sanctions and build up its military.

Washington has repeatedly warned Beijing over its support for Russia’s defence industrial base and has already issued hundreds of sanctions aimed at restricting Moscow’s ability to exploit certain technologies for military purposes. Friday’s sanctions include measures against companies in China involved in shipping machine tools and microelectronics to Russia."
"India should consider ban on microbeads in personal care products, researchers say",Amarion Scarlett-Reid,2024-08-23 00:00:00,"India should consider a ban on microbeads in personal care products, in line with many other countries in the world, say researchers.

Microbeads are a type of microplastic used in cosmetic products to exfoliate the skin. After a public uproar when the plastics were highlighted in Europe a decade ago, they were banned in the Netherlands in 2014, with many other countries following, including the US in 2015 and the UK in 2018.

But microbead production has yet to be banned in India, and is forecast to increase at “alarmingly high” rates as a result of demand from India’s fast-growing middle class. India’s personal care and beauty industry is one of the largest markets in the world.

Earlier this year, students at Cochin University of Science and Technology, India, analysed 45 widely available personal care products including face washes and shower gels, and found microbeads in 45% of products studied.

Although purposely produced microplastics constitute less than 10% of the total floating microplastics in oceans, with the remainder coming from broken down larger pieces of plastic, microbeads from personal care products constitute 93% of that primary microplastic pollution, according to the Cochin study.

Found in locations ranging from the top of Mount Everest to the bottom of the Marianas Trench, microplastic particles have been associated with a range of health issues in humans and wildlife, including hormone imbalances and gut blockages.

Their small size can allow them to “act as vectors for other contaminants” like poisonous metals, which are then accumulated at higher levels of the food chain, according to Riya Alex, a phD scholar at Cochin University who led the research.

Previous studies have identified microplastics in blood, urine, placental tissue and elsewhere in people’s bodies. “We still don’t know how it will affect us” Alex said. “It’s still a topic of research.”

Some microbeads are pigmented with potentially toxic chemicals, bright colours that tend to attract organisms that may feed on them out of curiosity, Alex added.

There is currently no regulation of microbeads in India , although the plastic waste management rules are regularly amended and there are some bans on single use plastic.

A portion of the products with microplastics the researchers analysed had labels promoting recycling and their eco-friendliness, which the researchers said was a case of “greenwashing” the personal care industry.

“Many environmentally conscious people who care about the environment don’t know these things are plastic” Alex said. Her research concluded there should be better labelling to promote awareness, replacement with natural substitutes, or outright bans on microbeads in products.

“If consumers get aware of this, they can make informed choices,” Alex told the Guardian. “If they know about it, they will automatically check the label, or at least they will avoid such products with beads altogether. Everything is market demand and supply. If there is no demand, brands will go back to natural alternatives.”"
"Weather tracker: 10 dead and 34,000 displaced in north-east India floods",Unknown,2024-08-23 00:00:00,"Incessant rain across Tripura, a state in north-east India, has created what has been described as the state’s worst flood situation in the last three decades. Persistent heavy rain from Monday to Wednesday resulted in several rivers exceeding danger and extreme danger marks, leading to widespread flooding that has caused the deaths of 10 people as well as displacing more than 34,000.

The southern Tripura districts had the worst of the floods and the 34,000 displaced people were being sheltered in the north of the region. There were 24-hour rainfall totals on Wednesday of 375.8mm recorded in Bagafa and 324.4mm in Belonia. The flooding and heavy rain led schools to shut down on Wednesday and Thursday, while Tripura University suspended all regular classes on Wednesday. The heavy rain was caused by a low pressure system situated over Bangladesh that is slowly moving westwards into north-east India. The situation is therefore only expected to worsen, with a further 100-150mm falling through Thursday and Friday as rivers continue to remain at breaking point.

Bangladesh also had floods this week. Nearly 3 million people were stranded due to impassable roads and a two people died. Bangladeshi residents had to evacuate with their belongings by boat and other makeshift transportation as flood water prevented other modes of transport. Road connections in several regions were severed, which isolated millions and hampered relief efforts. These floods were as a result of the same low pressure system which caused major flooding in Tripura and the situation is expected to worsen in Bangladesh too as the rains are forecast to continue.

Meanwhile in the eastern Pacific, nearly 1,000 miles off the coast of the California peninsula, is Hurricane Gilma, which has rapidly strengthened over the past couple of days, becoming a major category 3 hurricane early on Thursday morning. The storm, at the time of writing, possesses sustained wind speeds of 115mph that have enabled it to become the first major hurricane in the eastern Pacific this hurricane season. The storm is expected to continue to track west-northwest over the next several days before gradually weakening this weekend and into next week, long before it comes close to Hawaii. As a result, no coastal watches or warnings have been put into effect, though the National Hurricane Center will continue to monitor the hurricane."
Renewable energy auction secures enough power for 11m UK homes,Jillian Ambrose,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Great Britain’s renewable energy auction has secured enough new clean electricity projects to power 11m UK homes after the Labour government made record funding available to suppliers.

The £1.5bn auction will support the construction of new windfarms, solar farms and tidal power projects after the new government increased the amount of funding available to seven times the sums offered last year.

The sixth auction of its kind is expected to bring forward a deluge of new investment and jobs by giving developers a guaranteed price for each unit of clean electricity they generate, which is paid for by energy bills.

Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, said: “Today we have now achieved a record-setting round for enough renewable power for 11m homes, essential to give energy security to families across the country. It is another significant step forward in our mission for clean power by 2030 – bringing Britain energy independence and lower bills for good.

“These results show that together, this government and the energy industry are securing investment into our country. This auction has produced a record number of solar projects bolstering our mission for a solar revolution, we have powered forward with onshore wind, secured the largest commercial floating offshore wind project in the world and got the offshore industry back on its feet,” Miliband said.

The bulk of the funding was awarded to new offshore windfarms in UK waters. This could lead to enough new offshore windfarms to increase the UK’s capacity by 3.3GW, or enough clean electricity to power almost 8m UK homes before the end of the decade.

The auction also awarded contracts to about 20 new onshore windfarms with a total capacity of almost 1GW, and about 90 new solar farms with a total capacity of 3.3GW. Tidal power developers secured contracts for six new projects, and the world’s largest planned floating offshore windfarm.

The success of the closely watched industry auction was considered crucial if the new government hoped to achieve its election pledge to double onshore wind, triple solar power, and quadruple offshore wind by 2030.

Labour took action weeks after winning the July general election to increase the value of the auction by 50% compared with the funds promised by Conservative ministers. The move aimed to reignite investment in the UK’s clean energy industry after the previous government failed to award a single new offshore wind contract last year or remove the blocks on onshore wind."

"Pollution levels highly harmful to wildlife in quarter of England’s neighbourhoods, research finds",Helena Horton,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"More than a quarter of neighbourhoods in England have pollution levels that are highly harmful to wildlife, new data shows.

Friends of the Earth has named 27.5% of areas “nature pollution hotspots” in new research. These are defined as places where air, water, noise and light pollution all exceed levels that are damaging to nature.

Chelsea and Fulham was identified as the parliamentary constituency with the highest concentration of pollution hotspots, followed by Salford, Worsley and Eccles, Vauxhall and Camberwell, and Battersea.

The research found that 9,062 out of 32,844 neighbourhoods in England, areas of about 1,500 people designated for statistical purposes such as conducting the national census, are pollution hotspots.

One in six species are at risk of extinction in England, which is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. Wildlife is struggling to survive in many areas due to chemical pollution, the prevalence of pesticides, sewage dumping, air pollution and light pollution.

Since Brexit, fewer toxic chemicals are banned in the UK than they are in the EU, and the UK allows more types of poisonous pesticide than the bloc. Water pollution rules are also in the process of being loosened.

Sewage and slurry pollution in rivers causes nutrient levels to rise, which leads to large amounts of algal and plant growth, choking out aquatic species. Pesticides and chemicals leaching into rivers also kill and harm fish and invertebrates.

Air pollution including nitrogen dioxide from car engines threatens Britain’s native plant life, affecting roughly two-thirds of species. These fumes can reduce honeybees’ ability to recognise scent by up to 90% from only a few metres away, making it difficult to follow the trails of flowers.

Light pollution affects bats and moths, which are finding it harder to avoid light from businesses that keep their lights on all night, and street lights. These lights can also confuse migrating birds.

Friends of the Earth is calling for the Labour government to take action and to enshrine the right to a healthy environment in a environmental rights act. The proposed law would empower communities to hold regulators and public bodies to account to reduce pollution.

Sienna Somers, a nature campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Successive governments have failed to protect our environment from pollution and ensure people can continue to enjoy the health and wellbeing benefits of thriving nature. That’s why we’ve ranked pollution hotspots based on constituencies, so citizens and MPs alike can see how pollution impacts their local area and take action.

“While we can choose to avoid these polluted waters, many precious species cannot steer clear of the pollution we pump into their living rooms.

“Polluters must be held accountable for the harm they cause and forced to clean it up. Stronger laws to hold polluters accountable would also give power back to communities to defend our rights in court, creating a cleaner and healthier environment for wildlife and people alike.”"
"Extra cash for mental health would help UK more than new roads, study says",Phillip Inman,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Spending extra cash on mental health services would boost economic growth and improve the nation’s wellbeing more than building new roads, according to an academic analysis.

The report from the London School of Economics (LSE) argues that a rethink is needed inside Whitehall about how to approach spending decisions, with more focus on how the money actually improves people’s lives, particularly in terms of wellbeing.

Researchers assessed the cost-benefit ratio of policies across a range of departments in a drive to convince Rachel Reeves she should downgrade costly road projects such as the Lower Thames Crossing in favour of putting more cash into health, education and skills to boost to the economy.

The chancellor is due to announce a budget and comprehensive spending review next month, setting out the government’s spending priorities over the next five years.

Reeves is expected to announce severe cutbacks to some Whitehall spending to stay within budget constraints carried over from the previous Conservative administration. Some important road schemes have already been cancelled, including a planned tunnel near Stonehenge on the A303.

The LSE researchers assessed the gains made by individual spending decisions relative to their returns in terms of cash savings and wellbeing benefits in terms of their money equivalent.

They calculated that targeted spending on mental health and addiction services would not only help those affected, but also reduce the overall cost of health and welfare services while returning money to the exchequer as people returned to the workplace.

They also found that a psychological therapy service for addiction and employment support for moderate mental illness would pay back within two to three years.

While other policies were found to increase overall government spending, they were found to yield very high benefits per pound, for example a pledge to guarantee every person entitlement to an apprenticeship was judged to deliver benefits with a worth 14 times more than what they cost.

Similarly, they found more police officers would produce benefits through reduced crime worth more than 10 times their cost in terms of their impact on people’s wellbeing.

By contrast an assessment of road projects concluded the average scheme produces benefits worth just three times the cost while the proposed Lower Thames Crossing, connecting north Kent and south Essex, was said to offer benefits equivalent to just 1.5 times the cost.

Richard Layard, one of the report’s authors, said the savings from people having fewer health problems, going back to work earlier and claiming fewer benefits were worth prioritising because they reduce overall costs to the government.

Lord Layard, the emeritus professor of economics at the LSE and a former government adviser, said its report – titled Value for Money – was inspired by Keir Starmer’s promise, made when he was leader of the opposition, that “with every pound spent on your behalf, we would expect the Treasury to weigh not just its effect on national income but also its effect on wellbeing”.

The report will be launched on Tuesday at the offices of the Institute for Government thinktank in central London with the support of the former head of the civil service Gus O’Donnell, and Amanda Rowlatt, a former chief analyst at the Department for Transport.

Layard said the method used by the LSE team mimicked the cost-benefit analysis used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which assesses the value for money that new drugs and therapies offer the NHS.

He added: “We now have the science to estimate benefit-cost ratios for most policies, and these should be the basis of the next spending review.”

O’Donnell said: “This is an exceptionally important report. It should lead to major improvements in how the government uses our money to improve lives.”

The Treasury declined to comment."
"UK electric car drivers should be charged per mile, say campaigners",Gwyn Topham,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Campaigners have called on the chancellor to introduce a controversial pay-per-mile road charging scheme on electric cars, warning of a £5bn “black hole” in tax revenues from motoring.

In a letter to Rachel Reeves, the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) urged her to reform vehicle taxes, with fuel duty poised to dwindle in the coming decade as petrol and diesel cars are phased out.

The charity said it was an “urgent issue” as tax revenues were forecast to fall by £5bn between 2028 and 2033, and the public agreed that all vehicles should pay a fair share.

Silviya Barrett of CBT said: “The new chancellor faces a looming black hole. She can avoid it, in a way which is fair, and which garners broad public support. But she should start now, as this issue will only get more pressing.”

CBT said the easiest first step would be to levy a small pay-per-mile charge on zero-emission vehicles, with a transition period exempting existing drivers.

The letter said the group “fully appreciate that such a change would be difficult and be criticised by the opposition”. However, it said its research showed that 65% of the public believe it is fair for electric car drivers to be taxed, but at a lower rate than petrol and diesel drivers.

Fuel duty is now 53p a litre for petrol and diesel vehicles. Zero-emission cars will also pay vehicle tax for the first time in 2025.

The charity is leading a forum of 37 organisations supporting reform, including motoring and other transport industry bodies.

One is the RAC, whose head of policy, Simon Williams, said: “With fuel duty revenue set to fall further as more electric vehicles come on to the road, a replacement form of taxation needs to be introduced to avoid losing billions.

“A pay-per-mile system could be set up according to vehicles’ emissions with EV drivers paying the least to further encourage take-up and ‘gas guzzlers’ paying the most. We believe the Treasury needs to get moving on creating this new system sooner rather than later.”

The Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus and coach operators, said “pay-as-you-go” taxation would help the UK meet net zero carbon targets and help curb congestion.

Previous governments have had to back away from the idea of pay-per-mile or road charging schemes as politically toxic, despite widespread support from experts and MPs on the transport committee.

The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, was forced to categorically rule out any moves towards road pricing in his next term in office, backtracking on previous statements supporting a policy, after the “war on drivers” became a big campaigning issue for Conservatives.

A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are committed to supporting our automotive sector as we transition to electric vehicles in order to meet our legally binding climate targets.”"
Firms criticised by Grenfell inquiry face calls to be banned from public contracts,Robert Booth,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Companies criticised by the Grenfell Tower inquiry are facing calls to be banned from public contracts as it emerged that about £250m in deals have been made in the past five years with corporations involved in the high-rise’s refurbishment.

A leading member of Grenfell United, which represents bereaved family members and survivors of the tower’s 2017 fire, said companies found to have been to blame should no longer receive public contracts.

Searches of public contracts by the outsourcing data firm Tussell for the Guardian found numerous deals between councils, health authorities and housing associations and the companies that were involved in the disastrous refurbishment as well as their subsidiaries.

They include companies currently or formerly owned by Saint-Gobain, which made the combustible Celotex insulation used on the tower, and Rydon, the main contractor for the works.

Speaking before Wednesday’s publication of the final public inquiry report on causes of the 2017 fire, Karim Mussilhy of Grenfell United said: “If we see that these companies behaved fraudulently and manipulated the system, it’s not unreasonable to remove them from any public contracts and frameworks in the UK.”

Mussilhy’s uncle, Hesham Rahman, was among 15 disabled people who died in the fire. Rahman had been allocated a 23rd-floor flat, could not use the stairs, and no fire crews were able to reach him.

Rahman, 57, was trapped by dense smoke that penetrated his flat while he lay on his living room floor holding a wet cloth over his nose, the inquiry heard.

Joe Powell, the Labour MP for Kensington and Bayswater, which includes Grenfell Tower, said that if he were in the government’s position he would suspend the ability of Rydon and Saint-Gobain to bid for public contracts “until they are able to properly account for what went wrong, and that includes properly contributing financially to solving the building safety crisis”.

He added: “I would absolutely not want to see anybody working with Arconic [the US firm that made the combustible panels that were the main cause of fire spread], and I think they should be held accountable, both through the Met [police] investigation and in this [inquiry] report, and they should be contributing to paying to solve the building safety crisis.”

Members of the Grenfell community believe Wednesday’s report should increase the likelihood of criminal prosecutions and will end what the counsel to the inquiry, Richard Millett KC, described as a “merry-go-round of buck-passing” by companies and public authorities.

A cross-party parliamentary housing group said it would rethink a sponsorship deal with Saint-Gobain.

The all-party parliamentary group on healthy homes and buildings includes members from the Labour and Conservative benches. Approached about the arrangement with Saint-Gobain by the Guardian, Jim Shannon, the group’s chair and Democratic Unionist party MP, said it would “reconsider” the deal.

The first phase of the inquiry found that the insulation contributed to the blaze and released toxic gas. “We want to ensure the wishes of those who lost loved ones are fully taken into account,” Shannon said.

The pressure for consequences for the companies involved comes amid anxiety among bereaved and survivors that any criminal trials are probably about three years away.

The inquiry has cost public authorities well over £200m, largely in legal fees, and there is frustration at the continued commercial success of several of the businesses involved.

Kingspan, which made a small amount of the insulation and was accused in the inquiry of “misleading the market about the safety and compliance” of its foam insulation on tall buildings, has achieved rising pre-tax profits in the years since the disaster, hitting €794m last year.

Arconic made a pre-tax profit of $706m in 2022.

By contrast, Studio E, the architecture practice involved in the refurbishment design, went into liquidation in 2020 and Rydon Group made a £15m pre-tax loss over the last two years as it paid millions to fix fire safety issues on other projects.

The bill for running the public inquiry has reached £173m, while the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the London fire brigade spent a further £15m each on their participation.

The Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, which managed the block, racked up £6m in inquiry costs. Further millions spent on lawyers by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and the Home Office have yet to be disclosed.

Grenfell United has joined with the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group and families involved in the infected blood inquiry to call for a national oversight mechanism to ensure that recommendations that emerge from costly public inquiries are not ignored.

Powell said it was a good idea to have “a system that means future governments will also have to properly account for implementation”.

In a statement, Celotex said it and Saint-Gobain wished to “reaffirm their deepest sympathies to everyone affected by the devastating tragedy at Grenfell Tower”.

“Through the inquiry process and the internal review conducted, Celotex Limited has sought to understand and learn from the issues raised by the fire,” it said. “Independent safety tests commissioned after the review showed the system described in Celotex RS5000 marketing literature met relevant safety criteria.

“Celotex Limited does not design or install cladding systems and did not do so at Grenfell Tower. The design, construction and component selection for the Grenfell Tower facade were decisions made by construction industry professionals.”

A spokesperson for Arconic said: “The fire was a terrible tragedy and as Arconic remembers the 72 people who died, our thoughts remain with the families, friends and all of those affected.

Harris and Biden pitch for steel votes in Pittsburgh in first joint appearance on campaign trail,George Chidi,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on Monday made their first post-convention joint appearance on the presidential campaign trail, celebrating Labor Day with a tribute to union workers in Pittsburgh.

“We are so proud to be the most pro-union administration in American history,” Harris said. “I love Labor Day. I love celebrating Labor Day, and Pittsburgh is the cradle of the American labor movement.”

Between comments about the administration’s support for organized labor and Donald Trump’s attacks on labor organizing, Harris, the vice-president, spoke against the pending purchase of US Steel by Nippon Steel, arguing that the iconic Pennsylvania steel company should remain in the hands of American owners.

“US Steel is an historic American company and it is vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies. And I couldn’t agree more with President Biden: US Steel should remain American-owned and American-operated.”

The United Steelworkers union, representing about 10,000 US Steel employees, opposes the $14.9bn deal, taking issue with Nippon Steel’s alleged violations of the union’s rights concerning change of control under their four-year basic labor agreement signed in 2022. The union and the companies are in arbitration talks.

Harris again voiced support for the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) act, a broad basket of labor reforms that would spur union organizing.

Kenny Cooper, president of the IBEW union, introduced Biden and Harris, noting that the passage of the Butch Lewis Act by Harris’s tie-breaking vote saved the benefits of two million union members. “They were only tied up for one reason,” he said. “We couldn’t find a Republican senator.”

Harris also cast the tie-breaking vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, which the USW International president, David McCall, said in comments had been “revolutionizing the cement, chemical, glass and steel sectors along with other traditional core industries”.

Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, also opposes the Nippon Steel deal and has said he will block it if president. Biden announced his opposition to the Nippon Steel deal in March.

Less crisply perhaps than Harris, Biden described the accomplishments of his administration in Pennsylvania, from investments in clean energy to infrastructure money. He noted that his administration required project labor agreements that respected labor rights and required American products, while reminding listeners that Donald Trump appointed union busting officials to the National Labor Relations Board.

“Wall Street didn’t build America,” Biden said. “The middle class built America and unions built the middle class.”

The appearance of Biden and Harris together provides an image of how the two may campaign in the waning days of the election. Biden described Harris as having “the backbone of a ramrod and the moral compass of a saint”.

Harris spent the morning in Detroit, hailing the virtues of union organizing – the five-day work week, sick leave, vacation time and other benefits – with labor leaders at Northwestern High School.

“We celebrate unions because unions helped build America, and unions helped build America’s middle class,” she said. “When union wages go up, everybody’s wages go up.”

Biden is the first sitting president to walk a union picket line, supporting the United Auto Workers in their dispute with major car manufacturers in September 2023. “You guys – the UAW – you saved the automobile industry back in 2008 and before,” Biden shouted through a bullhorn on the picket line in Michigan. “You made a lot of sacrifices, gave up a lot. The companies were in trouble. Now they are doing incredibly well and guess what? You should be doing incredibly well too.”

Shawn Fain, president of the UAW, has been both a strident voice reinvigorating the American labor movement and a strident opponent of Trump. “Donald Trump is all talk, and Kamala Harris walks the walk,” Fain said at the Democratic national convention in August, while wearing a shirt that said “Trump is a scab”. Harris supporters chanted that phrase in Detroit this morning.

Though Trump called in his acceptance speech before the Republican national convention for Fain to be “fired immediately”, the Republican nominee has made overtures to labor voters during his run to return to office. The renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and his proposed tariffs of 10-20% on foreign trade have been central to his outreach, arguing that this will bring manufacturing back from offshore plants.

But Project 2025 – a conservative playbook for a second Trump administration penned by the Heritage Foundation – aims to end merit-based employment for thousands of unionized federal workers; calls for changes to “protected concerted activity” which would allow employers to retaliate more easily against union organizing; and eliminate the “persuader rule” requiring company disclosures when hiring union-busting consultants.

Trump has also flip-flopped in public comments about the electric car industry, initially calling for an end to electric car mandates but recently walking that rhetoric back after the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, endorsed his candidacy. During an interview on Musk’s X/Twitter social media space, Trump gushed at Musk’s approach to labor relations.

“They go on strike,” said Trump. “I won’t mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, ‘That’s OK. You’re all gone. You’re all gone. So every one of you is gone,’ and you are the greatest.”

That prompted the Teamsters president, Sean O’Brien – who spoke at the RNC convention to the surprise of many labor leaders – to walk his own overtures towards Trump back. “Firing workers for organizing, striking and exercising their rights as Americans is economic terrorism,” O’Brien said."
"Chase warns against using system glitch to filch cash: it’s ‘fraud, plain and simple’",Victoria Bekiempis,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"The US banking giant Chase has made clear that taking advantage of a system “glitch” to extract cash was “fraud, plain and simple” despite it becoming a TikTok trend.

Chase Bank’s warning on Monday came in response to viral social media posts where customers purportedly tried to withdraw more money than they had in their accounts by exploiting a banking system delay.

Users claimed that they knowingly deposited bad checks for often large sums of money, and then withdrew the money from Chase ATM’s right away, before the check could bounce, according to People.

Chase said in a statement that they fixed this problem and warned sternly that the trend was in fact just simple check fraud.

“We are aware of this incident, and it has been addressed,” Chase commented in a statement. “Regardless of what you see online, depositing a fraudulent check and withdrawing the funds from your account is fraud, plain and simple.”

The number of Chase customers who tried to do this is not immediately known.

One video posted on social media shows purported participants shouting with joy and throwing cash in the air. Other videos, however, show purported participants then later upset after seeing huge negative balances on their bank accounts once the bad checks had finally bounced yet their withdrawals of cash were still accounted for.

Social media users who observed the viral trend unfold frequently reacted with humorous quips.

“Check kiting. It’s called check kiting. And it’s been around since the invention of… checks,” Cornell University law professor Dan Awrey wrote on X."
Biden to join Harris on campaign trail for first time since dropping out of race,Robert Tait,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"Joe Biden will join Kamala Harris on the campaign trail for the first time on Monday since standing aside six weeks ago to let the vice-president claim the presidential nomination following a poor debate performance.

The pair were due to appear together in Pittsburgh in the vital swing state of Pennsylvania at a Labour Day event aimed at cementing support from trade unions, a key Democrat constituency and a bedrock of Biden’s support as he has styled himself as “the most pro-union president in US history”.

Harris is expected to assume that mantle with a pledge to oppose the sale of US Steel – which is headquartered in Pittsburgh – to the Japanese company, Nippon. Biden has already voiced his opposition to the proposed sale.

Before her arrival in Pittsburgh, a Harris campaign official said she would “say that US Steel should remain domestically-owned and operated and stress her commitment to always have the backs of American steel workers.”

Harris’s commitment represents one of the few specific policy promises she has made since her ascent to top of the Democratic ticket following Biden’s 21 July announcement that he was abandoning his re-election bid.

Biden has since endorsed Harris and the pair appeared briefly together on stage at last month’s Democratic national convention in Chicago.

While the president has spent the last two weeks holidaying in California and at his home in Delaware, he is expected to campaign for Harris – focusing in swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin with a high concentration of white working-class voters whose allegiance may be crucial in November.

Harris has promised “a new way forward” while loyally adhering to the Biden’s policies, treading a thin line between distancing herself from his administration’s perceived economic failings – particularly on inflation – while tying herself to its success stories.

The emphasis on Monday appeared likely to mainly express her continued adherence to Biden, who became the first president to appear on a picket line last September when he joined striking car workers in Michigan, another crucial battleground state, in a show of support for the United Auo Workers (UAW) union.

Monday’s event is expected to be attended by local and national leaders of major unions including the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the United Steelworkers and the AFL-CIO, the main US trade union body. Also expected were Bob Casey, the Democratic senator for Pennsylvania who is running for re-election, and the state’s governor, Josh Shapiro, who Harris considered as her running mate before eventually choosing Tim Walz.

Earlier, the vice-president visited Michigan – also a union stronghold – for an event in Detroit, where she was to be joined by the governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and two other union leaders, Shawn Fain of the UAW, and Randi Weingarten of the American Federation of Teachers.

Polls show Harris and Donald Trump running neck-and-neck in both Pennsylvania and Michigan, despite holding a small but consistent lead over the Republican nominee in national surveys. Both states are considered part of the Democrats’ “blue wall”, along with Wisconsin. It is the outcome in these states, plus a small number of other battleground states in the south and south-west, rather than the national vote total that is likely to determine the winner in November’s election under the US state-by-state electoral college system.

Trump has also pitched for union support and has sought the endorsement of the Teamsters union, whose head, Sean O’Brien, addressed July’s Republican national convention. However, JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, was booed last week when he spoke at a conference of the International Association of Firefighters and claimed to be part of “the most pro-worker Republican ticket in history”."
Hewlett Packard to pursue Mike Lynch’s estate for up to $4bn,Dan Milmo,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise has confirmed it will push ahead with a high court lawsuit against the estate of the deceased tech tycoon Mike Lynch in which it is seeking damages of up to $4bn (£3bn).

The US company said in a statement it would follow the legal proceedings “through to their conclusion” despite Lynch’s death last month when his yacht sank off the coast of Italy.

HPE won a civil claim against Lynch in the English high court in 2022, after accusing him and his former finance director Sushovan Hussain of fraud over its $11bn takeover of his software company Autonomy in 2011.

A ruling on damages is expected soon, although the judge presiding over the case, Mr Justice Hildyard, wrote in 2022 that he expected final damages to be “substantially less than is claimed”.

Lynch, 59, who was cleared in a separate criminal fraud trial over the Autonomy deal in the US in June, and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah, were among seven people who died after the Bayesian superyacht sank off the coast of Sicily last month.

HPE said: “In 2022, an English high court judge ruled that HPE had substantially succeeded in its civil fraud claims against Dr Lynch and Mr Hussain. A damages hearing was held in February 2024 and the judge’s decision regarding damages due to HPE will arrive in due course. It is HPE’s intention to follow the proceedings through to their conclusion.”

Oliver Embley, a partner at the London-based law firm Wedlake Bell, said HPE must balance legal, moral and reputational issues over whether it pursued Lynch’s estate for damages.

“They are a publicly traded company and they have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders. Legally they are obliged to act in their shareholders’ best interests, but morally continuing the claim is questionable. And from a publicity perspective it could backfire on them. Effectively they would be suing his widow and that does not look good optically,” he said.

Lynch’s widow, Angela Bacares, was onboard the Bayesian when it sank but was among 15 people who were rescued. According to the Sunday Times rich list, Lynch and Bacares’s combined wealth was £500m.

The Sunday Times first reported that HPE was poised to pursue Lynch’s widow for up to $4bn.

A representative for Lynch’s family declined to comment.

Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for corporate governance in the US state of Delaware, where HPE is incorporated, said the company would probably be protected from a shareholder lawsuit if it declined to seek damages from Lynch’s estate. Elson said HPE would be shielded by the state’s “business judgment rule”, which protects company board decisions.

“If you make a business decision that was in good faith and were informed and careful about making it, then that decision is protected legally,” he said."
Four people killed in shooting on Chicago train – reports,Edward Helmore,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"Four people were shot and killed on a Chicago metro train early Monday, according to news reports.

Police said they had received a 911 call at about 5.27am that three people were shot on a train at the Forest Park CTA Blue Line station.

Forest Park police officers arrived to find four victims. Three were pronounced dead at the scene. A fourth was transported to hospital, where they also later died.

Police said the suspect fled the scene but was apprehended on a CTA Pink Line train after police got a description from surveillance video. Police said a gun was recovered.

Officials said the incident appears to be isolated and there is no further threat to the public.

“Although this was an isolated incident, this heinous and egregious act of violence should never have occurred, none the less on a public transit train,” the CTA said in a statement."
San Francisco 49er player Ricky Pearsall released from hospital after shooting,Victoria Bekiempis,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"San Francisco 49er football player Ricky Pearsall was released from the hospital after being shot in the chest during an attempted robbery this weekend.

The suspected shooter, a 17-year-old boy, was arrested and will be charged in juvenile court, according to NBC Sports. He has not been publicly identified.

The 49ers said in a statement that Pearsall, 23, “continues to recover from a bullet wound to his chest” following his release on Sunday.

“He and his family, along with the entire San Francisco 49ers organization, would like to thank the San Francisco Police Department, emergency medical services, doctors and staff at San Francisco General Hospital,” the team said.

San Francisco police said that they received a report about a shooting around 3.30pm Saturday in Union Square, a popular shopping area. When officers arrived, they found two men with injuries, who were both taken to hospital.

Police subsequently determined that one of the injured men tried to rob Pearsall. Authorities think Pearsall tried fighting back, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, and that the alleged gunman was injured during this altercation.

Police said that multiple rounds were fired during the incident and that the suspect was shot by his own gun. Authorities think that the would-be robber acted on his own and did not prey on Pearsall because he is on the 49ers, NBC Sports reported.

The San Francisco police chief, William Scott, said that the investigation remained active. “This kind of violence is simply unacceptable in our city,” Scott reportedly said.

The wide receiver’s mother, Erin Pearsall, expressed gratitude on Saturday, recognizing that his injuries could have been far worse.

“I want to thank GOD for protecting my baby boy. He is extremely lucky, GOD shielded him. He was shot in the chest and it exited out his back,” Erin Pearsall said in a Facebook post reported by Fox KTVU. “Thanks be to GOD it missed his vital organs. He is in good spirits right now. Life is so precious, my friends. Please love each other. My son was spared today by the grace of GOD. Please pray for my baby.”

Gun violence is a top cause of premature death in the US, with firearms killing more than 48,000 annually. Firearms injuries rank among the five leading causes of death for people age one through 44, according to the American Public Health Association.

In June, the US surgeon general, Dr Vivek Murthy, declared gun violence a public health crisis. Murthy has urged the US to ban automatic rifles, mandate universal background checks, and approve legislation that would limit their use in public areas.

Murthy has also pressed for penalties against persons who fail to store their weapons safely. Congress would have to pass legislation in order for Murthy’s proposals to materialize across the US, which is unlikely due to its historic opposition to gun regulations, according to the Associated Press."
